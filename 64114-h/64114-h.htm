<small>SHE IS TAKEN BEFORE THE COMMANDER</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">I was</span> awakened from a deep slumber by the
glare of a lantern upon my eyes, by the
weight of a heavy hand upon my shoulder,
and by a deep voice roaring out: &#8216;Here y&#8217;are,
then! Another convict, is it? Who&#8217;s to say
what&#8217;s right aboard a craft where everything&#8217;s
wrong? Out you come, my lively!&#8217; And,
still half asleep and blinded by the light and
deafened by the fellow&#8217;s roaring voice, I was
dragged as though I had been a child out of
the sail and held erect.</p>

<p>A second man holding a lantern raised it
to my face and peered at me. I had seen
both fellows in this place before; they were
the boatswain and the sailmaker.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>&#8216;What are you a-doing down here?&#8217; said
the sailmaker.</p>

<p>The boatswain now let me go, and I stood
upright before the two men, still dazed and
horribly frightened, though my wits were
slowly returning.</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8217;m doing no harm,&#8217; said I, blinking at
the light, which, as it was held close, put an
insufferable pain into my eyes. &#8216;I hid myself.
I want to get to Australia.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Australia, is it?&#8217; thundered the boatswain.
&#8216;Why, you young rooter, d&#8217;ye know
we ain&#8217;t bound to Australia? Where did ye
come aboard?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Woolwich.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;D&#8217;ye know this is a convict ship?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes, I know it.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Has he been a-broachin&#8217; of anything?&#8217;
said the sailmaker, holding high the lantern
and slowly sweeping its light round the interior.</p>

<p>&#8216;What are ye?&#8217; said the boatswain, whose
voice was louder than that of any man I had
ever heard or could dream of.</p>

<p>&#8216;A runaway boy,&#8217; said I. &#8216;Take me on
deck. I&#8217;m sick for the want of light.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>&#8216;Sails, d&#8217;ye hear him?&#8217; said the boatswain.
&#8216;By the great anchor, as my old
mother used to say, but here&#8217;s one I allow as
has squeezed through the hawse-pipe on his
road to the quarter-deck, for, hang me, if he
hain&#8217;t a-hordering of us already.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What&#8217;s your trade, Jimmy?&#8217; said the
sailmaker, addressing me. &#8216;Nuxman or jigger,
or are you a lobsneaker, hey? Self-lagged,
by the Lord!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Come along aft and see the capt&#8217;n,&#8217; said
the boatswain.</p>

<p>He then spoke to the sailmaker about the
sails which they had apparently descended to
view, and, catching me by the arm, walked me
under the hatch, where he came to a stand.</p>

<p>&#8216;Been here since Woolwich, ye say?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes,&#8217; I answered.</p>

<p>&#8216;All in the dark?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What have you eaten and drunken?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I brought some food with me.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Are you one of a gang?&#8217; And here he
rolled a pair of large glassy eyes over the
casks and coils of rope. He was a very<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
powerful seaman, deeply bitten by small-pox
and without a right ear.</p>

<p>&#8216;I am alone,&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;Up ye go!&#8217; he cried, and he partly
hoisted and partly tossed me through the
hatch on to the upper deck.</p>

<p>It was broad day, though the interior of
the forecastle into which I had emerged was
gloomy. Beyond the forecastle-entrance the
white and windy sunshine was coming and
going to the frequent sweep of clouds athwart
the sky. The brightness of that light thrilled
my eyes with pain, and I turned my back
upon it, putting my hand to my head for a
few moments.</p>

<p>&#8216;&#8217;Tisn&#8217;t everybody, mates, that goes to sea
afore the mast as signs on,&#8217; said the boatswain,
generally addressing a few sailors who
had risen from their sea-chests or lounged out
of the shadow forward to look at me.</p>

<p>&#8216;If this here was a female convict ship,
Mr. Balls,&#8217; said one of the men, &#8216;you&#8217;d
find that that there covey was after one of
the gals.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Let him wash hisself,&#8217; said another seaman,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
speaking with his hands plunged deep
in his pockets, &#8216;and there&#8217;ll be nothen likelier
aboard us. Dummed if he don&#8217;t remind me
of my Mary Hann.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Let&#8217;m sit,&#8217; said another of the sailors.
&#8216;I&#8217;ve got a drop of grog in my chest. I
started on my first voyage in the fore-peak
and knows what head seas mean down there
to a country stomach.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Sit and breathe,&#8217; said the boatswain,
backing me to a chest. &#8216;Fetch your sup
along, Joe. He don&#8217;t look much of a
rascal, do he?&#8217; And I observed that he
eyed me very closely and with looks of surprise
and doubt which somewhat softened the
fierceness of his one-eared, glassy-eyed face.</p>

<p>I was glad to sit. My strength had been
fearfully overtaxed by confinement and by
my mental sufferings and want of air. I
was afraid I should faint and my sex be discovered.
A pannikin with a dram of black
rum in it was given to me. I smelt the fiery
stuff and asked for water.</p>

<p>&#8216;Neat, my warrior, neat, and down with
it!&#8217; cried the fellow who had given me the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
rum. &#8216;Water&#8217;s for washin&#8217; in. Don&#8217;t talk of
rum and water. Soap and water, my heart;
that&#8217;s it.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Give the lad water,&#8217; said the boatswain.
&#8216;Blowed if I&#8217;m going to take him aft drunk.&#8217;
One of the fellows brought a pannikin of
water and turned a small quantity into the
rum. I looked up into his face and thanked
him with a smile and drank.</p>

<p>&#8216;Ever at sea afore, Jacky?&#8217; said a sailor.</p>

<p>&#8216;D&#8217;ye hear the grit of old hoss in his
squeak that you asks that?&#8217; said the deep-lunged
boatswain.</p>

<p>&#8216;And to think,&#8217; said a surly-looking sailor,
&#8216;that the town-crier&#8217;s still a-ringing for him
and his grandmother still a-calling at every
public-house to see if he ain&#8217;t there!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What d&#8217;ye say to a rinse, bo&#8217;, afore ye
lays aft?&#8217; said the fellow who had offered me
the rum. &#8216;A clean face may stand the little
chap in with the old man,&#8217; said he, addressing
the boatswain.</p>

<p>&#8216;Have a clean-up, young &#8217;un, afore I takes
ye aft?&#8217; said Mr. Balls.</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes,&#8217; I answered.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>The boatswain stepped out, and in a few
moments returned with a tin dish of cold
water and an old towel. &#8216;Turn to now and
polish away,&#8217; said he. &#8216;Bear a hand. A
clean face is like a clean shirt; it gives a
man a chance.&#8217;</p>

<p>I dipped a corner of the towel into the
water and rubbed my face, and when I had
looked at the towel I judged I had wanted
washing very badly indeed. By this time
some fourteen or fifteen seamen had come
about me; they lounged and stared, and commented
freely in growling, very audible voices
upon my appearance and new suit of pilot
cloth. It was the forecastle dinner-hour,
whence I concluded the time was something
after twelve. Nearly all the ship&#8217;s company
were below, some seated on their chests, eating,
a few in their hammocks, smoking, and
looking at me over their swinging beds; some,
who had drawn close, brought their dinners
in their hands, a cube of beef or a hunch of
pork on a biscuit, that served as a trencher;
these fellows flourished sheath- or clasp-knives,
and they chewed slowly, as men whose teeth<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
had long grown artful and wary in the business
of biting on shipboard.</p>

<p>The interior was indeed a grim, gloomy,
massive picture; the men were rudely and
variously and some of them half savagely
attired; the place was roofed with hammocks;
tiers of bunks arched into the head where
they vanished in the gloom. A lamp swung
under a great beam, and its light was needed,
despite the brightness of the day outside,
and of the shaft of daylight that floated
through the open scuttle forward and hung
in the obscurity like a square of luminous
mist, as a sunbeam streams through a chink
of closed shutter. A number of stanchions
supported the upper deck, and suits of oilskins
hung upon nails swayed against these
wooden supports like hanged men as the ship
bowed and lifted her head. The atmosphere
was scarcely supportable with its mingled
smells of strong tobacco and the fumes of
the kids or tubs in which the greasy boiled
meat had been brought in.</p>

<p>&#8216;Aft with us now, youngster,&#8217; said the
boatswain, &#8216;and give an account of yourself.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
And may the Lord ha&#8217; mercy on your soul!
This here&#8217;s a convict ship; there&#8217;s nothen
going under six dozen. Everything over
that&#8217;s a yard-arm job.&#8217;</p>

<p>He grasped me by the arm and walked me
out of the forecastle, but not, I thought, with
the temper he had dragged me out of my
hiding-place with. By this time my sight
had strengthened, and, though the broad daylight
outside brought the tears to my eyes,
the pain passed in a moment or two.</p>

<p>I glanced at the deck of the ship, but
should not have known the vessel as the <i>Childe
Harold</i>. Strong barricades, studded with iron
spikes, had been erected a little way abaft the
foremast and upon the quarter-deck, leaving a
narrow open space betwixt this after-fencing
and the front of the cuddy. Each barricade
had a gate. At the after-gate stood a red-coated
sentry, with a loaded musket and fixed
bayonet. At the great central or main-hatch
stood another sentry. In the recess formed
by the overhanging lap of the poop-deck was
a stand of arms. The barricades made a huge
pen of the waist, main-deck, and part of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
quarter-deck. On the left or port side ran a
strong barrier, like a great fence, leaving a
narrow gangway betwixt it and the bulwark.
This I afterwards understood was to enable
the sailors and others to go backward and
forward without constantly obliging them to
pass the sentries and enter the space barricaded
off for the convicts.</p>

<p>I glanced behind me as I walked with the
boatswain, and saw a sentry stationed at the
forecastle, and two more, each with muskets
and fixed bayonets, paced the break of the
poop athwartships to and fro in a regular,
pendulum, sentinel swing, which brought them
crossing each other always in exactly the same
place. I had young, very keen eyes. All
these points I had collected before we had
gone half the length of the main-deck gangway.
Not a convict was to be seen. I had
caught a sight of two men walking together
on the poop right aft, near the wheel, and
I also saw Will on the poop standing to leeward
beside another young apprentice; and
on the other side of the deck, at the head of
the poop-ladder, was the officer of the watch.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>As I advanced with the boatswain I saw
Will look, make a step toward the brass rail
which protected the fore-end of the raised
deck and stare a moment; he then wheeled
round, walked to the side and gazed at the
white wash of passing water. The ship was
under a great spread of canvas, heeling over
and sailing fast, and the yeasty swirl alongside
was swift and dazzling. I could not see the
horizon over the weather bulwarks; but to
leeward it was all open sea, green, ridging and
flecked, with a cold blue sky over the trucks
and many large white clouds sailing down
into the west. Two or three women, with
shawls over their heads, sat on the edge of a
little square hatch under the break of the
poop; some children were running about near
them. These women stared very hard at me
as I passed.</p>

<p>&#8216;Hullo, bo&#8217;sun!&#8217; called out the man who
was standing at the head of the poop-ladder.
&#8216;What have you got there?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;A stowaway, sir.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;When did you find him?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Just now, sir.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>&#8216;Where?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Under the forecastle.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Step him up here.&#8217;</p>

<p>The boatswain made me ascend the poop-ladder,
himself following. This was a deck
well remembered by me; I had spent a long
hour upon it with Tom and Will when we
visited the ship in the docks. All was unchanged
here; the boats swung in their
davits; the sweep of deck went white as a
freshly peeled almond to the grating abaft the
wheel; the skylights sparkled and the bright
brass binnacle-hoods mirrored the sun in
crimson stars. On high the full-breasted
canvas rose in space after space of milky
softness with a stately swaying of the button
of the truck, as the ship leaned to the sea and
lifted to windward again.</p>

<p>The person who had ordered the boatswain
to bring me on to the poop was, as I
afterward got to know, the second mate, Mr.
Thomas Masters, a full-faced man, short and
strong, his nostrils tinged with purple, no
visible throat, and a strange, leering smile
upon his mouth when he looked or spoke.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
Will left the poop by the other ladder; his
fellow-apprentice leaned against the lee rail
staring at me. The second mate turned his
face in the direction of the two men whom I
had observed walking aft abreast of the wheel.</p>

<p>One of these two cried out: &#8216;Who&#8217;s that,
Mr. Masters?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;A stowaway, sir,&#8217; answered the second
mate.</p>

<p>Both persons approached. As they advanced
along the deck, a third man came up
out of the cuddy or saloon through the companion,
and joined them. The three stepped
up to me. One was Joseph Sutherland, the
captain of the vessel, a lean man with a slight
stoop, about forty years of age. His face was
thin; the skin had a look of leather from long
exposure to weather; his eyes were a weak
blue with a tear in each corner, which kept
him mopping with a pocket-handkerchief.
Yet I liked the expression of his face; there
was the heart of a man in it.</p>

<p>The second person was Surgeon Russell-Ellice,
R.N., the doctor who had supreme
charge of the convicts. This man was without<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
any hair on his face; and the hair on his
head was cropped as close as mine was or
a convict&#8217;s. He had large, soft brown eyes
and a brown skin, blue on the cheeks and lip,
where he shaved. His mouth was firm, with
an expression that seemed to lie between
scornfulness and self-complacency. He had a
manner of thrusting out his chest and backing
his head when he spoke, and of so holding
himself when he stood or walked as to stretch
the inches of his stature to their limits.</p>

<p>The third person was Captain James Barrett,
of the &mdash;th Regiment of Foot. He was
the captain in charge of the guard. He was
of the average type of British officers; smart,
well-dressed, good-looking, with a glass which
he put into his eye to examine me.</p>

<p>I ran my gaze over the faces of these
three, not then knowing who they were,
though I guessed by their air that they were
chiefs in the ship. I did not feel afraid; my
end had been triumphantly accomplished.
I needed but look over the rail on either hand
to know that we were out upon the wide
ocean, that, though England indeed could not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
be very far astern, yet the land was as far
away for my purpose as if it had been a
thousand leagues distant. And then there
was the consideration of my sex to give me
nerve; these people were gentlemen. I had
but to declare myself to make sure of tender
usage. But though I did not mean to do this,
and prayed heartily that no occasion might
arise to force me into it, yet the sense of it
was a refuge that wonderfully supported my
spirits, the more particularly now that I had
observed there were women on board and
quarters where, should the worst come to the
worst, I could live with my own sex.</p>

<p>The captain and the doctor (as I shall
henceforth call Surgeon Russell-Ellice for the
sake of brevity) eyed me all over for some
moments without questioning me&mdash;the captain
with looks of surprise and wonder that came
very nearly to commiseration, the other
with frowns and suspicion like fire in his
gaze.</p>

<p>&#8216;What are you doing on board my ship?&#8217;
said Captain Sutherland.</p>

<p>&#8216;I wish to get to Australia, sir,&#8217; said I.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>&#8216;What! Without paying? Do you know
that this is a convict ship?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes, sir.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I could have him brought to the gangway
for this,&#8217; said the doctor. &#8216;Has he been
searched, bo&#8217;sun?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;No, sir.&#8217;</p>

<p>The doctor stamped his foot. &#8216;Search
him!&#8217; he cried.</p>

<p>Captain Sutherland looked on as though
he recognised a superior in the doctor. At
this moment Will came up to the lee ladder
and leaned beside the other apprentice, listening
and watching. The boatswain threw open
my pea-jacket and drove his huge hands into
my pockets. I was thankful not to feel the
blood in my cheeks; had this piece of rude
handling reddened my face the doctor would
have found me out. His soft but scrutinising
eyes were upon me.</p>

<p>&#8216;He&#8217;s a plump young man,&#8217; exclaimed
Captain Barrett, in an aside to the commander
of the ship. &#8216;What&#8217;s in your hold to make
him fat?&#8217;</p>

<p>The boatswain drew out my handkerchief,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
the two new clay pipes I had put in my pocket
that I might seem a man when the crowning
occasion arose, and the tinder-box and matches.
Happily I had left the little parcel of candles
in the sails. The boatswain dived his immense
tarry fingers into the pockets of my
waistcoat and found nothing.</p>

<p>Whilst I was being searched I observed
that one of the sentries who marched athwart
the poop was the man who had looked over
the rail when I was in the boat alongside off
Woolwich. I met his glance and saw he did
not remember me. I never once turned my
eyes in the direction of Will.</p>

<p>&#8216;Is that all?&#8217; said Dr. Russell-Ellice.</p>

<p>&#8216;That&#8217;s all, sir,&#8217; replied the boatswain,
replacing my cap on my head, after feeling
the lining.</p>

<p>&#8216;Where do you say this lad was found?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Just for&#8217;ards of the bulkhead under the
fo&#8217;c&#8217;sle.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;It&#8217;s a store-room,&#8217; said Captain Sutherland.</p>

<p>&#8216;Has it been searched?&#8217; exclaimed the
doctor.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>&#8216;I dunno what ye mean by searched,&#8217; answered
the boatswain sullenly, resenting as a
merchant seaman the imperious manner of
the Royal Naval surgeon.</p>

<p>&#8216;Captain,&#8217; cried the doctor. &#8216;You know
what I mean; explain to this man.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Have you overhauled the store-room,
Balls, for others of this fellow&#8217;s pattern?&#8217;
said the captain.</p>

<p>&#8216;No, sir.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Then go with the sergeant of the guard,&#8217;
said the doctor; &#8216;examine every nook and
corner, and make your report.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Ay, ay, sir,&#8217; answered the boatswain very
sulkily again, and swinging round on his heels
he quitted the poop with a sullen walk eloquent
of malediction. The doctor drew back as if
he would admit it was now the commander&#8217;s
right to ask questions. Captain Barrett gazed
at me strenuously through his eye-glass. His
intent regard made me feel very uneasy.</p>

<p>&#8216;What&#8217;s your name?&#8217; said Captain Sutherland.</p>

<p>&#8216;Simon Marlowe, sir.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What are you?&#8217; I hung my head. &#8216;No<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
need,&#8217; he exclaimed, &#8216;to ask if you were ever
at sea; your hands are like a woman&#8217;s.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;He&#8217;s a deuced good-looking chap, doctor,&#8217;
said Captain Barrett in another aside. &#8216;Plump
as a partridge, by the great horn spoon!
What runs a chap to fat down in your hold,
captain?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What have you come to sea for?&#8217; said
the captain, speaking with a severity whose
forced note my ear could not miss. Indeed,
he seemed to find a sort of pleasure in looking
at me.</p>

<p>&#8216;I want to get to some friends in Tasmania,
sir,&#8217; I answered.</p>

<p>&#8216;What names?&#8217;</p>

<p>I was ready for him; for weeks I had
been rehearsing too diligently the part I was
now playing not to be ready. &#8216;Satchell, sir.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Where do they live?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;At Hobart Town.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What&#8217;s their address, boy?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I don&#8217;t know, sir. I&#8217;ll find out when I
arrive.&#8217;</p>

<p>The doctor grinned gravely.</p>

<p>&#8216;&#8220;Arrive!&#8221;&#8217; cried the captain. &#8216;How do<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
you know I&#8217;ll allow you to arrive, as you
call it? &#8220;Arrive,&#8221; you monkey! You&#8217;ve
committed a felony; you&#8217;ve broken into private
premises; for all I can tell, you may
have broached the cargo of the ship. There
are men in that prison down there,&#8217; said he,
pointing to the main-hatch, &#8216;who are being
transported for life for smaller crimes.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8217;m sorry, sir. I would do nothing
wrong. I will gladly pay for my passage
with my labour if you will give me work&mdash;such
work as I can do.&#8217;</p>

<p>The doctor put his hand on the commander&#8217;s
arm and whispered in his ear.
Captain Barrett exclaimed: &#8216;If you&#8217;re satisfied
with the lad&#8217;s account of himself, Captain
Sutherland, he shall wait upon me, if you
like.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What work have you for two servants?&#8217;
exclaimed the doctor.</p>

<p>&#8216;I like his pluck, d&#8217;ye know,&#8217; answered
Captain Barrett, &#8216;and just now he happens to
be rather friendless, Ellice.&#8217;</p>

<p>The doctor looked annoyed and walked to
the rail.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>&#8216;Where do you come from?&#8217; asked the
commander.</p>

<p>&#8216;London, sir.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Who are your people?&#8217; Again I hung
my head.</p>

<p>&#8216;He is in the right to look ashamed,&#8217; said
the doctor. &#8216;Take it that he has brought
great grief and distress upon a respectable
family by his mysterious disappearance. I
don&#8217;t believe for a moment,&#8217; continued he,
eyeing me sternly, &#8216;that he has friends at
Hobart Town. It&#8217;s just an ordinary runaway
case. He may have robbed some kind employer&mdash;perhaps
defrauded his own father.
His clothes are new and good. Where did
you get the money to buy these clothes
with?&#8217; he asked. I kept my head hung.
&#8216;Lads of your sort,&#8217; he continued, &#8216;get hold
of cheap romancing works&mdash;vile, lying fictions&mdash;books
which represent Jack Sheppard as a
greater man than Wellington. Little by little
they advance till they end there,&#8217; said he,
pointing, as Captain Sutherland had, to the
main-hatch. &#8216;Down there, weighted with
irons, branded as criminals, leaving their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
native country for ever, expelled by the just
laws of an outraged community, are many
men who have begun as you have begun&mdash;nay,
who may have started on their downward
career with a great deal more of
modesty than you have exhibited.&#8217;</p>

<p>Captain Barrett let his eye-glass fall,
whistled softly and lounged aft to the wheel.</p>

<p>All this while the decks had remained
comparatively deserted. Just at this moment
a boatswain&#8217;s mate tuned up his whistle, and
a number of seamen came out of the forecastle
and went to work in various parts of
the ship forward. The doctor continued to
lecture me; but I was looking at the strange,
grim scene of decks and did not heed him.
You would have thought, at sight of the
barricades, that the ship was full of wild
beasts; that man-eating and ravening creatures
took the air in the space inclosed by
the savage, iron-studded, bristling fence
work.</p>

<p>Suddenly, the sentry at the main-hatch
stiffened his figure, as though to a sudden call
to attention. He guarded a door at the extremity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
of a short wooden passage, broad
enough to allow one person to pass through
at a time. A man clothed as a convict
stepped through this door. On perceiving
him the doctor broke off, and went to the
brass poop rail and overhung it, gazing
eagerly. A second and a third convict appeared,
then a fourth; this man held a fiddle
in one hand and a bow in the other.</p>

<p>And now I heard a sound of heavy clanking
footfalls, as though a long end of chain
cable was being dragged along the deck, and
one after another, to the number of perhaps
seventy or eighty, issued the convicts, every
man, saving the first four, wearing iron rings
and chains upon his ankles, the chains triced
up to the waist. They were clothed in the
same garb I had observed on board the <i>Warrior</i>;
a dingy sort of gray striped with red
and a kind of Scotch cap. The convicts who
had led the way cried out sharply: they
delivered their orders fast and fierce, like a
drill-sergeant savage with yokel recruits. The
fellows ranked themselves into a line with
something of the discipline of soldiers; then<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
the fellow who held the fiddle put it into his
neck and began to screw out a march.</p>

<p>&#8216;Attention! Left turn!&#8217; shouted one of
the unshackled convicts. &#8216;Quick march!&#8217;</p>

<p>The fiddle played, and away stepped the
line of men, all keeping time to the music,
faltering but a little to the movement of the
ship, and their irons clanked and their chains
rattled as they tramped.</p>

<p>I lost all sense of my situation when I saw
those convicts. I made a step to the side of
the doctor, and my eyes seemed on fire as I
gazed. Tom was not one of them. I guessed
that this was a gang brought up to exercise
and take the air according to the notions of
Doctor Russell-Ellice. It sickened my heart,
but it made my spirit mad to witness those
wretches marching round and round within
the wild-beast-like enclosure, to listen to the
mocking squeak of the fiddle threading the
dull metallic tramp of the ironed felons, to
feel that Tom was one of them and amongst
them below, ironed as they were, apparelled
and disciplined as they were, guarded by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
soldiers with loaded muskets&mdash;himself as innocent
as I, as the dark-eyed doctor beside
me, as the commander of the ship, who appeared
to have forgotten me in watching this
strange march of felons clanking round and
round to the tune of the fiddle.</p>

<p>&#8216;That&#8217;s my idea,&#8217; said the doctor to the
captain. &#8216;That&#8217;s the way to keep them in
health. You may judge by their manner of
marching that they enjoy the music.&#8217;</p>

<p>The captain looked at his second mate
and smiled sarcastically. Another person
had by this time arrived on the poop; he,
like Captain Barrett, was attired in undress
uniform. I afterward learned that he was
Lieutenant Chimmo, one of the two officers
in charge of the guard. They approached
and looked hard at me&mdash;so hard that I
imagined Captain Barrett had divined my
sex. Their observation won the attention of
Captain Sutherland, by whom I had been
unheeded whilst he watched the convicts.
He said: &#8216;Get you down there to leeward
and wait till you&#8217;re wanted.&#8217; He spoke sternly,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
but almost in the same breath of his speech
his face relaxed, and he exclaimed: &#8216;Are you
famished!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;No, sir.&#8217;</p>

<p>The doctor shrugged his shoulders, as
though vexed that the captain should pity
me.</p>

<p>&#8216;Get you down to leeward,&#8217; repeated the
commander; and I went and stood at the
rail.</p>

<p>Will was aloft in the mizzen-top and the
other apprentice in the ratlines of the mizzen
shrouds at work there. I looked up at Will,
who kissed his hand. The act was boyish
and indiscreet, and I averted my face, for I
did not then know he was not to be seen from
the other side of the poop.</p>

<p>The clear wind was sweet and refreshing
after my many hours of confinement. I
glanced over the side and watched the feather-white
swirl of cloudy foam; the yeast burst
in a rainbow splendour from the bow and
raced astern in ridges of snow, and I saw the
spreading wake of the flying ship dancing
miles distant in the airy green that ran in a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
twinkling horizon round the sky. Far ahead
slanted a sail, and far abeam to leeward was a
dash of dusky-red canvas, whence I concluded
that the coast was not very remote.</p>

<p>The tramping convicts marched round and
round in single file to the tune of the fiddle.
Some of them were little more than boys,
eighteen or twenty years of age, and one or
two of them were gray-haired men. Their
dress was so levelling, and it seemed besides
to stamp so strong an impression of rascality
upon their faces, that one could not look at
the ironed gang without supposing them all
rogues and criminals of the worst sort. And
yet I&#8217;d fancy, as they came facing aft toward
the poop, I could see some countenances
which would have passed in the streets and in
company for comely, honest faces. But the
general type was very villainous; the brow
low, overhanging, and scowling: the eye small,
deep-set, and restless; the mouth coarse and
heavy, and the jaw strong, thick, defined like
a beast&#8217;s.</p>

<p>My eye rested upon one man. I was certain
I had seen him before. He was immensely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
broad-shouldered, pitted with small-pox. His
arms were too long for his body, and the
thickness of them and the fists were a giant&#8217;s.
His eyebrows were black; his eyes a deep
and fiery black; his nose coarse, spread, flat
and heavy at the nostrils. He had the look
of a Jew, and after I had watched him a little
while, I said to myself: &#8216;Yes, now I remember.
He is Barney Abram, the prize-fighter,
who was under sentence of transportation for
life in Newgate when I visited Tom in that
jail with Uncle Johnstone.&#8217;</p>

<p>I craved to see my sweetheart. I waited
for the hideous fiddle to cease squeaking, and
for the gang to go below and a second gang
to take its place, hoping that Tom might be
one in this second gang. I say I waited.
Rather, I stood hoping. Why they kept me
waiting down to leeward on that poop I could
not imagine. I guessed it would shock me
horribly to see Tom with irons on, marching
in convict&#8217;s attire, a mere machine at the will
of warders, themselves convicts; yet did I
passionately wish to see him that I might
make sure he was on board, for though I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
never dreamt that Will had mistook, still I
yearned to satisfy myself with my own eyesight.
But the gang continued to march
round and round to the strains of the fiddle.
Oh, the mockery of the blithe Irish tune the
fellow played, timed by the metallic tramp of
felons on the echoing deck!</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIX<br />


<small>SHE IS QUESTIONED BY THE DOCTOR</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">I was</span> kept waiting, I knew not why, and used
my leisure to gaze about me. I was without
fear. I had scraped, with a stout heart,
through the worst part, and cared little for
what might follow. I had made up my mind
to avow my sex if they should send me into
the forecastle to live. I was very sure I
should be unable to keep my secret amongst
that body of rough, blaspheming, joking
sailors. Nor should I be equal to the work
of a seaman&mdash;I mean as an ordinary seaman
or boy. It turned me dizzy to look aloft and
think of climbing those towering heights.</p>

<p>Whilst I thus thought, I used my eyes and
examined the ship. Opposite the main-hatch,
within the convicts&#8217; inclosure, stood a tall
box, something like a sentry-box; over it a
bucket was hung by an iron bar, and there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
was a short length of rope attached to the
bucket. I supposed the box was a sort of
shower-bath for the prisoners. The main
hatch was the only visible means of entering
and leaving the prison quarters. It was extraordinarily
protected, first, with heavy
gratings with a manhole for the passage of
one body, then by a strong railing of oak
stanchions of a triangular shape, thickly
studded with iron nails (the tops or heads of
these stanchions I could just see as they sank
like the vertical wires of a cage from the
sides of the hatch down to the lower-deck),
then by a strong bulkheaded passage or corridor
with a door at the end, as I mentioned
when I spoke of the sentry stationed there.
I saw two galleys. The forward one I guessed
was for the ship&#8217;s use, the after for the convicts;
for in this galley I had observed a
man in felon&#8217;s dress. A huge long-boat lay
stowed in chocks athwartships just forward of
the ship&#8217;s galley.</p>

<p>Such details to me entered like the very
spirit of prison life into the gleaming fabric of
the ship, soiling, debasing, so flavouring her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
that there was no magic in the pure freshness
of the ocean wind to purge her into sweetness.
Marvellous that human sin should subtly enter
and find expression in timber and hemp and
canvas, in bricks and mortar, in old hulks, in
prison piles&mdash;it matters not what&mdash;subduing
all suggestions to its own inspirations. I had
noticed how the sordid influence and degrading
quality of human wickedness had worked
in dismantled hulks, making more hideous
that which was already hideous with felon-carpentry;
and now here was all beauty in
this buoyant and bounding picture of a ship
in full sail, leaning from the shining breeze,
pouring into her wake the snow of the crested
and dissolving surge, dimmed and defiled and
saddened by her errand and cargo, by the
aspect of her decks, and by the noise of men
marching in irons.</p>

<p>All this while the doctor stood at the break
of the poop with his hands upon the rail,
watching the convicts exercising, and sometimes
nodding in time when the fiddler changed
his tune; the captain likewise watched the
convicts from the head of the weather poop<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
ladder; the two officers patrolled the weather
deck, and both of them constantly looked at
me when their walk brought them with their
faces forward; the second mate was near the
wheel, and the two sentries, with shouldered
muskets with shining bayonets, crossed and
recrossed each other at a little distance from
where I stood.</p>

<p>By-and-by the boatswain and a soldier
with stripes upon his arms came along the
narrow gangway from the forecastle. They
arrived on the quarter-deck, and the soldier,
looking up, saluted.</p>

<p>&#8216;Step up, sergeant, and you, Mr. Bo&#8217;sun,
if you please,&#8217; said the doctor. &#8216;Well,&#8217; said
he, when they had mounted the ladder,
&#8216;what have you found where the lad&#8217;s been
hiding?&#8217;</p>

<p>I was prepared to hear that they had discovered
my stock of provisions and the bottles
of water, and possibly the parcel of wax candles.
But I was not uneasy; I was ready
with a story. The sergeant, speaking with
an Irish accent, answered: &#8216;We have found
nothing, sirr.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>&#8216;Did you thoroughly overhaul the place,
Mr. Balls?&#8217; said the captain.</p>

<p>&#8216;Ay, sir. We&#8217;ve likewise been down into
the fore-peak. All&#8217;s right for&#8217;ards.&#8217;</p>

<p>I was astonished, for I had never doubted
that they would light upon my tins of meat
and the bottles. Whether they had honestly
overlooked the nook in which the things were
stowed or whether, having met with them,
they had resolved to keep the stuff to secretly
eat and enjoy, is a question I cannot answer.
Suppose this, they&#8217;d say nothing about the
bottles of water, lest one discovery should
force them into owning the other.</p>

<p>&#8216;Captain,&#8217; exclaimed the doctor, &#8216;I shall
want that lad locked up until I have satisfied
myself as to his motive in hiding!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8217;m quite willing to lock him up,&#8217; answered
the captain, &#8216;but I&#8217;m an old hand, and I may
tell you that there&#8217;s never much need to
scratch deep to find out your stowaway&#8217;s
reason.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8217;m not satisfied,&#8217; said the doctor, turning
his head and staring at me very sternly;
&#8216;you&#8217;ll lock him up, if you please.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>&#8216;Clap him in your jail; there&#8217;s a proper
prison below,&#8217; said the captain.</p>

<p>&#8216;Certainly not!&#8217; cried the doctor, with a
toss of his head, seemingly insensible of the
sarcasm of the captain&#8217;s suggestion. &#8216;He&#8217;s no
convict, sir, he&#8217;s the ship&#8217;s prisoner.&#8217;</p>

<p>The sergeant eyed me very steadfastly.
He suddenly saluted the doctor, and exclaimed:
&#8216;May I list him, sir?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Try him,&#8217; said the captain, dryly. &#8216;It&#8217;s
a sure sign a young chap wants to &#8217;list when
he hides in the fore-peak of an outward-bounder.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Leave that matter, sergeant. Captain,
you will be so good as to lock up that boy,&#8217;
said the doctor.</p>

<p>On this the captain told the boatswain to
send the steward to him. A man with prominent,
purple-tipped cheek-bones and blue
eyes, very narrow shoulders and legs arching
out to a degree I had never before beheld,
wearing a blue jacket decorated with rows of
buttons, came out of the cuddy. The captain
called him on to the poop.</p>

<p>&#8216;That lad&#8217;s a stowaway,&#8217; said the captain,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
pointing to me. The man looked. &#8216;By
order of the surgeon-superintendent he&#8217;s to
be locked up. Where? In the forecastle?
In the soldiers&#8217; quarters? You have spare
cabins in the steerage?&#8217;</p>

<p>The man answered: &#8216;Three.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Very well,&#8217; the captain said. &#8216;Take him
below and lock him up.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;You&#8217;re his jailor,&#8217; said the doctor, &#8216;and
I hold you responsible for his safe keeping.&#8217;
The steward looked uneasy and astonished,
and cast a glance at the marching file of
convicts.</p>

<p>&#8216;Here,&#8217; said the captain. The steward
approached him close. Something was said.
The steward then came to me and exclaimed:
&#8216;Come along, young man!&#8217; I followed him
down the steps on to the quarter-deck. At
this instant the fiddle ceased, the echoing
tramp of the felons was hushed, the convict warders
as before cried out sharply and
fiercely.</p>

<p>&#8216;This way,&#8217; said the steward; and I walked
after him through the cuddy door. Here
was a bright, cheerful interior. The <i>Childe<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
Harold</i> was a passenger ship, and her accommodation
aft was rich and fine. She was a
convict ship now, but they had made no
change. The bulkheads, ceiling, and trunk
of the mizzen-mast were beautiful with gilt
carving and paintings; narrow lengths of
brilliant mirrors flashed back the light that
streamed through the skylights; the chairs
and lounges were choicely upholstered. Whilst
I gazed, my imagination figured the grimy,
barricaded, sentinelled, &#8217;tweendecks prison in
which Tom was to live. I caught sight of
myself in a looking-glass. I had omitted to
pull off my cap when I entered the cuddy&mdash;an
oversight that might have convicted me
to a keen eye. I scarcely knew myself in
the glass. Spite of the rub I had given my
face in the forecastle, I was still dark with
the dirt of the store-room. It was as good
as a mask. No one would have suspected
the delicate skin of a woman under the
grime on my cheek.</p>

<p>&#8216;This way!&#8217; said the steward.</p>

<p>He led me down some steps that fell from
a small square of hatch close against the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
inside of the cuddy front. It was gloomy
down here. A corridor ran fore and aft, and
on either hand were two or three cabins.
The steward put his hand upon the door of
the first of these cabins.</p>

<p>&#8216;Step in,&#8217; said he. &#8216;Is this your first
appearance in quod, youngster?&#8217;</p>

<p>I did not understand him. He leaned
against a bunk, thrust his hand into his
trousers&#8217; pockets, and looked me over.
&#8216;What&#8217;s brought you into this day&#8217;s mess?&#8217;
said he. &#8216;Wasn&#8217;t you &#8217;appy at home?&#8217;</p>

<p>I resolved to answer the man civilly,
trusting he would befriend me.</p>

<p>&#8216;I have friends in Tasmania, and wish to
join them. I&#8217;m willing to work for nothing
if you&#8217;ll give me work I can do. I&#8217;m not
strong, sir.&#8217;</p>

<p>He asked me where I had come aboard,
if I had known before hiding that this was
a convict ship, where I had hidden, and how
I had managed for food. &#8216;You&#8217;re a young
gent,&#8217; said he; &#8216;that&#8217;s clear. Them &#8217;ands
have never done dirtier work than quill-driving
in some office, I&#8217;ll swear. Hope for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
your soul&#8217;s sake you haven&#8217;t run away for
wrong-doing, and that there&#8217;s no kind &#8217;arts
at home a-haching for you.&#8217;</p>

<p>I declared in the most solemn and impassioned
tones that I had not run away for
wrong-doing, and that I had hidden in this
ship for no other motive than to reach Tasmania.
He inquired my name, and said:
&#8216;Well, I don&#8217;t mind saying I like your looks.
I believe you&#8217;re honest and there&#8217;s no &#8217;arm in
you. What does that there doctor mean by
turning me into a jailor? I&#8217;m head-steward.
That&#8217;s what I shipped for. He gets his living
by looking after criminals at sea; and them
as ain&#8217;t criminals, according to him, must be
tarned into tarnkeys, is it? He be blowed!
Ye&#8217;ve had a tidy spell down for&#8217;ards. Since
Woolwich, hey? Well, the capt&#8217;n told me
to give ye a mouthful of grub, and that looks
well. I&#8217;ll turn the key upon ye, because it&#8217;s
the capt&#8217;n&#8217;s orders. But as for that there
doctor&mdash;he be blowed!&#8217;</p>

<p>He went out, leaving me easy, I may say
almost happy, so different had been the usage
I had received from what I had expected;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
though, to be sure, the doctor had yet to
settle accounts with me. But what could he
do? If he kept me locked up, I was still in
the ship that was carrying Tom across the
seas. If he threatened me with the gangway,
there was my sex. I might know&mdash;nay, I
would swear, myself a sailor&#8217;s daughter&mdash;that
there was never a seaman on board that ship
who would allow a hand to be lifted against
a girl.</p>

<p>I took a view of the little cabin I was in.
It was a steerage-berth, designed for the use
of second-class passengers. Two mahogany
bunks were affixed to the ship&#8217;s wall under
the circular porthole. In a corner near the
door was a convenient arrangement of
drawers and wash-stand and a flap, which,
on lifting, I found to be a looking-glass. I
went to the bunks to look through the porthole
at the sea, and beheld in the upper bunk,
on the bare boards, a large parcel. I could
scarcely credit my sight. It was, in truth,
the parcel of wearing apparel I had made up
when I put on my boy&#8217;s clothes and addressed
to the care of the captain of this ship and left<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
in my Woolwich lodging, on the bare chances
of my landlady sending it to the vessel! I
say it was truly extraordinary that those
clothes should be lying in the very cabin in
which I was now lodged.</p>

<p>Whilst I stood looking at the parcel and
musing upon the associations it recalled, and
speculating upon the ideas the landlady had
formed of me, the key was turned and the
steward entered.</p>

<p>&#8216;Here&#8217;s some lush and a mouthful of
grub for you,&#8217; said he. &#8216;It isn&#8217;t every stowaway
who&#8217;s waited on by a head-steward,
I can tell you. But it&#8217;s the cap&#8217;n&#8217;s orders,
and luck comes with looks in this blushen
universe.&#8217;</p>

<p>He placed a mug of red wine and a plate
plentifully heaped up with cold boiled beef
and ship-baked bread upon the wash-stand
and again left me, turning the key. I ate
heartily, and the wine did me good. I should
have been mightily thankful for soap and
water, but had not dared ask the steward for
such luxuries. I walked about the cabin
and looked through the portholes, and killed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
the time by thinking. I was used to being
alone, and after the darkness forward, with
the furious motion of the ship&#8217;s bows and the
noises in the hold and the thunder of seas
smitten by the thrust of the cutwater, this
lighted cabin was heaven with its tranquillity
and gentle motion of deck. I thought of
Tom, and struggled to realise his prison
quarters. Gloomy I knew they must be,
heavily grated and shrouded by its sentinelled
doorway as the main-hatch was; gloomy and
evil-smelling, repulsive and inhuman, with
spiked barricades and a prison and hospital.
But I could not witness the picture in imagination.
How and where did the prisoners
sleep? How and where did they eat? And
what was their fare?</p>

<p>And what would my uncle and aunt think
if they knew where I was? I imagined them
opening that door there and looking in and
seeing me dressed as a boy and leaning on
the edge of the bunk. So far my love had
marched to a conquering tune. And it was
not only that I had overcome several wonderful
difficulties for a young woman to encounter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
single-handed; it was not only that
I was in the same ship with my sweetheart,
bound to a land where we should be together,
where in God&#8217;s good time and with patience
we might come to dwell together as husband
and wife, happy in our love, happy under
new skies, happy in our eternal severance
from the odious and inhuman associations of
our native country; I, too, should have suffered
with Tom, and taken my share of his
misery, if not of his humiliation and degradation.
This was a sweet and noble supporting
thought. It was the one triumph of my love
which gladdened me most to think of.</p>

<p>After I had been locked up two or three
hours, and whilst the sun was still strong
over the west, filling all that part with a
moist scarlet light, the key was violently
turned and Doctor Ellice walked in. My
blood was fired by his insolent entrance, as
though he were a warder with a right to
break in upon a prisoner at any instant; but
I swiftly cooled when I recollected that he
did not know I was a woman. In truth, for
the moment I had forgotten my masquerade.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
And, indeed, there is nothing so hard to sham
as the airs and behaviour of the other sex.
A woman may look a young man to perfection,
as, indeed, I did; but her female tricks
and instincts will be breaking through if
vigilance sleep an instant. You will find
this so by observing even the most accomplished
actress in male parts.</p>

<p>&#8216;I have come to talk to you,&#8217; said the
doctor, very sternly. &#8216;I don&#8217;t understand
your presence in this ship. Your explanations
to the captain and to myself are not
sufficient, and are unsatisfactory so far as they
go.&#8217; And then he began to question me.
Who was I? What was my age? Would I
swear that I was going to Tasmania to seek
some relations? Would I swear that my
name was Simon Marlowe? By this time my
blood was on fire again, and, weakened as I
was by what I had passed through, I might
guess the old flashing lights were in my eyes
as I looked at him.</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8217;ll tell you this much about myself,&#8217; said
I, stepping up to him and swelling my breast
and tossing my head after my fashion when I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
was in a rage: &#8216;my father was a sailor, and I
know enough of the sea to inform you that
the master is the only head and authority
which the people on board need recognise.
You are not the master of this vessel. What
right have you to come here and talk to me
as you do, and to insult me as you lately did
in the hearing of others, with your doubts as
to my honesty and my motives for leaving
home and the rest of it?&#8217;</p>

<p>He gazed at me in silence with the utmost
astonishment. Indeed, he looked crestfallen.
His lips lay apart in a sort of yawn of wonder,
but he quickly recollected himself, as you will
suppose of a man who, as I afterward learned,
had made several voyages in charge of convicts,
and was used to felons. His face darkened
with temper, but his self-mastery was fine,
and there was no passion in his tones.</p>

<p>&#8216;You do not understand. You are insolent
and ignorant, though you are educated and
refined, and altogether superior to the situation
in which you have placed yourself. On this
I base my suspicion and I must have the truth.
I am supreme in this ship. The captain obeys<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
my orders. This is a Government ship, and
you are subject to my discipline.&#8217;</p>

<p>He then began to question me afresh very
deliberately. But I observed that he no longer
insisted upon my swearing that my name was
Simon Marlowe and so on; and indeed it was
wonderful that so sensible a man should ask
questions which only a fool would put; for,
let me have answered him as I might, would
he have believed me? I struggled with my
temper and replied to him; now and again I
would not answer, and he passed on. Once
he threatened to bring me to the gangway, by
which he meant that he would order me to
be flogged; I folded my arms when he said
that and looked him in the eyes.</p>

<p>He continued to question me very sternly
nevertheless; demanded full particulars of my
coming on board; asking whether I had
travelled directly from my home wherever it
might be, or loitered at Woolwich before hiding
in the vessel. I told him I had stayed a short
time at Woolwich.</p>

<p>&#8216;Are you acquainted with any one of the
convicts on board this ship?&#8217; he exclaimed,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
bursting out with this question abruptly, as
though to catch me unawares.</p>

<p>My eyes sought the deck. I went to the
bunk and looked through the porthole, turning
my back to him.</p>

<p>&#8216;Answer me,&#8217; he cried.</p>

<p>I slowly confronted him and said: &#8216;Yes, I
know one of the convicts.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Which is the man?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Barney Abram.&#8217;</p>

<p>He stared in good earnest, made a step the
better to see me, my back being to the porthole,
and said: &#8216;You know Barney Abram?
Probably one of the worst characters in this
ship. You are a friend of his?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I did not use the word friend, sir. I
know Barney Abram by sight. I recognised
him as he paced the deck this afternoon.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Where have you met him on shore?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;He was pointed out to me.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Where&mdash;where?&#8217;</p>

<p>I paused to let him know I was not to be
frightened by his imperious manner, and
answered: &#8216;In Newgate Prison.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Were you a prisoner?&#8217; he asked quickly.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>&#8216;I was a visitor.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Whom visiting?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;The jail.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Who pointed the man out to you?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;My companion.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Who was your companion?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8217;ll not answer that question,&#8217; I replied,
&#8216;because if I tell you who that companion was,
I shall be acquainting you with more than I
intend you shall know. But neither will I tell
you any lies.&#8217;</p>

<p>He looked hard at my hands. I held
them up close to his face and exclaimed:
&#8216;Judge for yourself, sir. I have been no
prisoner!&#8217; and laughed.</p>

<p>&#8216;You are the most impudent young dog I
ever met,&#8217; said he, with a sort of admiration
in the anger of his looks. &#8216;Where were you
educated?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I never went to school; I was educated
at home,&#8217; I answered, feigning an air of shyness
and swinging my leg.</p>

<p>&#8216;Is your mother living?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;No, sir.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Father?&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>&#8216;I have a stepfather,&#8217; I answered.</p>

<p>&#8216;And his is the home you have run away
from, I suppose.&#8217; He mused for a few
moments and then said: &#8216;Put on your cap,
and follow me.&#8217;</p>

<p>He led me through the saloon on to the
main-deck, and so through the gate in the
after barricade where the sentry stood. I
followed him without alarm, though I wondered
with all my might why he should bring
me into this convicts&#8217; inclosure. Did he mean
to send me below to live among the felons, or
to be locked up in their bulkheaded prison?
Not very likely. But what did he mean to
do?</p>

<p>There was not a convict to be seen within
the barricades. The sunset was rich and
thunderous, and the air full of red light; the
wind had freshened and blew very cold. The
watch on deck were shortening sail, and the
three royals and the mizzen top-gallantsail
and some fore and aft canvas were slatting
and jumping overhead, with a few seamen
hoarsely bawling at the clew-lines, and some
hands sprawling aloft. The first mate was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
now in charge, and he stood on the poop
looking up, watching the fellows climbing.
This man I had seen aboard the ship in the
East India Docks. Tom knew him and had
shaken hands with him. The captain was
walking with the two military officers, the
sentries crossed and recrossed the poop-break,
and round about the little booby-hatch, close
against the cuddy front, were two or three
soldiers and a few women and children.</p>

<p>&#8216;Pass the word for Barney Abram,&#8217; said the
doctor to the sentry at the door of the main
hatch.</p>

<p>The soldier did so, and after a minute or
two the prize-fighter, with irons on his legs
and a chain triced up to his waist, came
through the door, attended by a convict
warder, or &#8216;captain.&#8217; He was a fierce and
brutal-looking creature when you saw him
close. His face was pitted with small-pox, and
embellished besides with the scars of many
bloody conflicts in the ring. He wore an
extraordinary expression; it was not a grin;
it was not a smirk; it was a fixed, crafty leer
of knowingness.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>&#8216;Abram, look at this young man and tell
me who he is,&#8217; said the doctor.</p>

<p>The prize-fighter, resting his elbows in the
palms of his immense hands, leaned his ugly
face forward and stared at me; he contracted
his brows whilst he looked as though he
hunted through his memory. At last he
exclaimed: &#8216;I devver saw the young gentlebud
before.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;He says he knows you,&#8217; says the doctor.</p>

<p>&#8216;By sight,&#8217; I exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8216;That&#8217;s dot ibprobable,&#8217; said the prize-fighter,
with a glance at the sentry and a
complacent look-round, and holding up his
head.</p>

<p>&#8216;Look at this young man,&#8217; said the doctor.
&#8216;Where have you met him?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Debber saw bib in all by life. S&#8217;elp be
as true as by &#8217;air&#8217;s growig,&#8217; returned the
prize-fighter.</p>

<p>&#8216;He says he saw you at Newgate.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I was there,&#8217; answered the prize-fighter,
pursing up his leathery under-lip.</p>

<p>&#8216;Observe him well and try to recollect if
he was a prisoner?&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>&#8216;Dot in by tibe,&#8217; said the prize-fighter.</p>

<p>This insinuation, after what I had said,
enraged me. &#8216;You know I never was a
prisoner, sir,&#8217; I cried. &#8216;You are acting inhumanly
in trying to confirm your hopes, but
not your suspicions, that I was one. I was on
a visit to the jail for my entertainment. My
companion and I were conducted to the
prisoners&#8217; visiting-room. There I saw Mr.
Barney Abram in conversation with a stout,
dark lady, gaily attired, and I looked at him
with attention because he was pointed out to
me as the greatest prize-fighter of the age, and
that is why I mentioned his name when you
asked me whether I knew any of the convicts
on board.&#8217;</p>

<p>A savage glow of pleasure brightened the
prize-fighter&#8217;s eye as he listened; my audacious
address, my reference to the brute&#8217;s fame,
acted upon his spirits like a can of drink.
The sentry eyed me askant; the warder with
a satisfaction which his flat, ruffianly face
could not conceal.</p>

<p>&#8216;You saw be talking to by wife,&#8217; said<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
Barney Abram!&mdash;&#8216;a stout, splendid woban,
&#8217;adsobly dressed as you put it, sir. The circumstance
is all correct.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;You can go below,&#8217; said the doctor.</p>

<p>I received a fierce, exulting, congratulatory
glance from the bruiser as he turned about in
his shackles to re-enter the door. He might
have meant to applaud me for my fearless
speech, or, which is more likely, he might have
meant to wish me luck in the scheme which
had brought me into conflict with the surgeon,
and which he would naturally hope and believe
was criminal.</p>

<p>The doctor now told me to pass on to the
quarter-deck, and I thought he meant to
take me below and lock me up again.
Instead of which he left me standing outside
the barricade and went on to the poop,
where he joined Captain Sutherland and his
military companions, all of whom had been
gazing at us from over the brass rail whilst
we talked with Mr. Barney Abram. I could
not understand the meaning of this doctor&#8217;s
purposeless questions and behaviour, but I dare<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
say I was right when I supposed he intended
to let everybody see and understand he was
first in the ship.</p>

<p>Always, in the days of the convict ship,
the unhappy criminals were dispatched across
the sea in charge of a naval medical officer
appointed by the admiralty, and called the
surgeon-superintendent. The ship was virtually
placed in his hands to do what he pleased
with, and, though I don&#8217;t suppose he was empowered
to interfere in the navigation of the
vessel, he was undoubtedly privileged to order
the master to call into such ports on the way
as he (the surgeon) might choose to name;
thereby retarding the voyage of the ship, and
perhaps imperilling her, as was the case with a
certain convict ship which was nearly lost
through the surgeon ordering that she should
make Simon&#8217;s Bay under conditions of season
and weather which the captain declared
dangerous. Hence there was usually a strong
feeling between the surgeon-superintendent
and the captain and mates. I suspected something
of the sort here, and believed Doctor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
Russell-Ellice had given himself a great deal
of unnecessary trouble to prove me a rogue,
merely that the captain and the mates should
see what a very clever fellow he was, and how
very much in earnest also in his resolution to
strut to the very topmost inches of his little
dignity and his brief authority.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XX<br />


<small>SHE CONVERSES WITH HER COUSIN</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Presently</span> I stepped leisurely into the recess
under the poop where the soldiers and the
women were. One was the pretty young
woman who had given me a smile when I
came on board the ship at Woolwich. She
viewed me with her soft, dark eyes with a
wistful admiration, but I could not observe
that she remembered me. The three or four
soldiers without belts, their jackets unbuttoned,
lounged against the bulkhead,
smoking their pipes. I was now used to being
stared at, and gave them no heed. Whilst I
thus stood waiting for what was next to
happen, Will came along from his berth forward.
When he saw me, he seemed to pause,
as though not knowing what to do. With
the most pronounced air I could contrive I
averted my face and looked into the saloon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
through the window, and when I glanced
again my cousin was out of sight. I was
very much in earnest that he should not get
in trouble through me; nay, I desired that
for a long time yet he and I should keep as
wide apart as the two ends of the ship. He
was boyish and imprudent, and might at any
moment say or do something that would lead
to the disclosure of my sex, and, for all I
knew, to the revelation of my motive in hiding
in this ship.</p>

<p>The soldiers talked of the convicts, and I
pricked up my ears, thirsty for all information
of the gloomy, hidden quarters where Tom
lived. One asked if the people were kept
in irons throughout the voyage. Another
answered, No; he believed the irons were
taken off after the ship was out of the Bay of
Biscay.</p>

<p>&#8216;I couldn&#8217;t &#8217;elp laughing,&#8217; said one of the
soldiers. &#8216;I was on sentry below and heard
a chap say to some others: &#8220;I don&#8217;t mind
praying, but cussed if I&#8217;m going to pray for
the Governor of Tasmania! I&#8217;ll pray for rain
if it&#8217;s wanted, but not for a bloomed Governor.&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
&#8220;Who asks ye?&#8221; says one of the convicts.
&#8220;It&#8217;s to be a part of the prayers,&#8221; said the
other. &#8220;Me pray for the Governor of Tasmania!&#8221;&mdash;and
here he swore and used such
language that I had to caution him.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I wouldn&#8217;t pray for ne&#8217;er a Governor if
I was a convick,&#8217; said the pretty young
woman, with a toss of her head and a side-glance
at me. &#8216;It&#8217;s a shame to make a joke
of sacred things. Should a convick be made
to pray for his jailer? Would the Lord listen
to the prayer of a sailor who asks a blessing
on the bo&#8217;sun who&#8217;s just been flogging him?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;There&#8217;s some queer chaps downstairs,&#8217;
said one of the soldiers. &#8216;There&#8217;s a fellow
they call the smasher&mdash;a little, gray-haired
man with the kindest of faces, and speaks as
soft as pouring out milk; he&#8217;s lagged for one
of the most awful crimes. There&#8217;s a play-actor&mdash;dunno
what right he&#8217;s got down there.
They sails under false colours. Dessay if
he&#8217;d got his right name ye&#8217;d find him some
one as had been tiptop at Drury Lane and
the best of theayters. There&#8217;s a quiet, pleasing-looking
chap, lagged for scuttling.&#8217; A<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
woman asked what that was. &#8216;Sinking a
ship by making a hole in her.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;The villain!&#8217; cried the woman. &#8216;I hope
they&#8217;ll not give him a chance with his tricks
here.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8217;m sorry for that chap, somehow,&#8217; said
the soldier. &#8216;If I was a painter I&#8217;d like to
draw his picture. I&#8217;ll point him out some
time or other, and then you take notice, Jim,
of his melancholy face. One picks up a lot
on sentry.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;A bad lot,&#8217; said another soldier, spitting.</p>

<p>I listened eagerly and longed passionately
to ask questions, but durst not. Yet I might
be sure that the soldier spoke of Tom, and I
loved the fellow for speaking of him kindly;
and it was another proof that my sweetheart
was in the ship.</p>

<p>A child came and stood in front of me
and looked up into my face. It was a pretty
little girl. I stooped and patted her cheek
and kissed her, took her by the hands and
jumped her into a little dance, which kept
her laughing. I knew which was the child&#8217;s
father by the pleased look one of the soldiers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
regarded me with. It was the man who had
spoken kindly of Tom. When I found this
out I kissed the child again and talked to her
of the ship and the sea. I observed that my
manners and speech controlled the listeners.
They all knew I was a runaway stowaway,
and though they could know no more they
might suspect a great deal more. And yet
they viewed me respectfully and talked with
a sort of civil reference to me as though I
was a gentleman, listening.</p>

<p>The lights were burning very red but gradually
dimming in the west, and the sides of the
seas slipped away from under the ship in hard,
dark-green slopes, laced with spray, and
the froth of their heads was faintly coloured
by the sunset. The heel of the ship was sharp,
and she broke through the billows in thunder.
There was a mighty noise of whistling and
raving aloft, and the strange shrill shrieking of
the foaming and dissolving salt alongside made
me wonder what that sound in the wind was.</p>

<p>An apprentice came off the poop and
struck a bell suspended this side of the
quarter-deck barricade. A minute or two<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
later a convict passed through the door of the
main-hatch and placed himself beside the
sentry; a second and then a third emerged
until a considerable number of men had
assembled; they formed in a close-packed
column which stretched about half-way to the
convicts&#8217; galley; the soldier with whose child
I played, seeing me looking at the convicts,
exclaimed: &#8216;They&#8217;re getting their supper.
Them&#8217;s the messmen. As the fellows receive
their cocoa or whate&#8217;er it be, from the galley,
they carries it below, one by one.&#8217;</p>

<p>I imagined that Tom might be amongst
that set of convicts, and made a movement
with the idea of walking some distance forward,
where I should be able to see; but I
stopped myself on reflecting that the doctor
was probably at the poop rail overhead looking
on.</p>

<p>&#8216;&#8217;Taint bad discipline, taking it all round,&#8217;
said the soldier, speaking to all who chose to
listen, though I seemed to find his remarks
intended for my amusement or enlightenment.
&#8216;It&#8217;s mostly settled aboard the hulks before
the parties come aboard. So I&#8217;m told. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
convicts they think proper to trust are made
petty officers of. There&#8217;s first and second
captains, captains of divisions, captains of
wards. Then some of them are made cooks
of, t&#8217;others barbers, and every mess has its
head. With this sort of arrangement they
keeps each other in order.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Do any privileges go along with these
appointments?&#8217; asked one of the soldiers.</p>

<p>&#8216;The privilege of being appointed.&#8217;</p>

<p>I listened, but asked no questions. I
dared not exhibit interest. I could not forget
that these soldiers formed a portion of the
convicts&#8217; guard.</p>

<p>&#8216;I notice,&#8217; said one of the soldiers, &#8216;that
they puts them there malefactors to all sorts
of ship&#8217;s work. They were helping the sailors
wash the deck down this morning. They
work hard, as though eddicated under the
muzzle of the carbine. A sight of difference
there was &#8217;twixt the sailors&#8217; scrubbing and
their&#8217;n.&#8217;</p>

<p>I was watching the convicts whilst I listened
to the soldier&#8217;s talk, when some one
inside of the cuddy called out: &#8216;Marlowe!&#8217;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
I forgot my feigned name, and did not respond.
The voice again called, on which, with a start.
I looked through the cuddy door and saw the
steward.</p>

<p>&#8216;I reckoned as much,&#8217; said he, with a
laugh. &#8216;&#8217;Taint every purser&#8217;s name as fits
like old boots. Step this way.&#8217;</p>

<p>I entered. Just then the doctor came
down the companion-steps at the end of the
cuddy and entered an after-cabin on the port
side. He paused a moment, as though to
observe me, but did not speak. A young
man, whom I supposed to be an under-steward,
was lighting the cabin lamps, but there still
lived a wild flush of western light, and you
saw plainly by it.</p>

<p>The steward began by informing me that
I had no business in the ship; that by stowing
myself away on board a convict ship I
risked the chance of being made a felon of, of
receiving six dozens at the gangway, of being
hanged at the yard-arm. In thus reassuring
me he gave himself the airs of the captain of
the ship. He then added: &#8216;However, I like
your looks, as I told you before, and I&#8217;ve put<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
in a good word for you with Captain Sutherland,
who, I may tell you, don&#8217;t think any
the worse of a youngster like you for squaring
up, as he&#8217;s heard you&#8217;ve done, to the doctor.
The doctor himself owned to the captain,&#8217;
said he, lowering his voice and looking aft
toward the surgeon&#8217;s cabin, &#8216;that he got
rather more from you than he knew what to
do with.&#8217; He then abruptly inquired if I
possessed any clothes besides those I wore. I
answered I had not.</p>

<p>&#8216;Got any money?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;How much ought I to want?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;How much ha&#8217; ye got?&#8217; said he.</p>

<p>&#8216;All I shall need on my arrival,&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>He looked puzzled, eyed me all over, then
approaching me by a step he exclaimed with
an earnest, confidential face: &#8216;Jokin&#8217; apart,
young man, who are you and what&#8217;s your
object in cutting this here caper?&#8217; Finding
I did not reply, he continued: &#8216;You&#8217;re to
have all the money you want when you
arrive? And you haven&#8217;t money enough to
pay your passage to get what&#8217;s awaiting for
you?&#8217; He paused. &#8216;Well, now, see here.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
You&#8217;ve got no business aboard, and you stood
to be whipped, and you stood to be hanged
for hiding in a Government transport. You&#8217;ve
got to be fed, and gent or no gent, you must
work.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8217;m willing and anxious to work.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;The captain&#8217;s handed you over to me.
There&#8217;s plenty of hands for&#8217;ard, most of them
about as sarviceable at a pinch as you&#8217;d be
likely to prove. We&#8217;re short of a man aft,
and you&#8217;ll do for the post. Can you wait at
table?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8217;ll try.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Well, you may rise to it. We&#8217;ll see.
You&#8217;ll be wanted to carry the dirty dishes
for&#8217;ard for the cook&#8217;s mate to wash, to help
bring the dishes along from the galley, and
to hang about here whilst the officers are
eating, ready to run to the galley on arrands.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8217;ll do all that willingly,&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>He then told me that the second steward
slung his hammock next door to the pantry
in the steerage, but as there were two or three
empty cabins down there I was welcome to
use a bunk in the one in which I had been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
locked up. &#8216;As for a bed,&#8217; said he&mdash;&#8216;you&#8217;d
better ask the sailmaker to give you a piece
of old canvas, and the butcher to give you a
bundle of straw; you&#8217;ll get all the mattress
you&#8217;ll want out of that. If I can meet with a
stray blanket you shall have it. That pilot
jacket, though a good coat, ain&#8217;t quite up to
the knocker for table work. Pity you haven&#8217;t
got a little loose cash upon you. I&#8217;ve got a
spare jacket which,&#8217; said he, taking a view of
my shoulders, &#8216;would fit you for breadth to a
hair. But not to button across; why, I never
see such a chest on a young fellow. And now
you can turn to,&#8217; said he; &#8216;the table&#8217;s to be
got ready for dinner and you can help.&#8217;</p>

<p>I requested him to lend me some soap and
a towel. He grinned and asked me if there
was any perfumery he could oblige me with.
&#8216;But you&#8217;re right,&#8217; said he. &#8216;You&#8217;re in want
of a wash-down.&#8217; He left me, and presently
returned with a piece of marine soap and a
coarse towel. He then told me where I should
find a bucket, and recommended me to draw
some water at the head pump on the forecastle,
and to be careful not to spill any on the deck<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
as I brought it along if I did not want to be
sworn at by the officer of the watch.</p>

<p>I took a bucket from a rack near the mainmast
and went along the gangway, as I term
the alley betwixt the barricade and the bulwarks.
My heart was almost light. The work
I was to be put to was just such as I should
have chosen out of the whole group of duties
of the big ship. It was work that would keep
me away from the forecastle hands; it would
not put more upon me than my strength was
equal to. Best of all, I was to occupy a cabin
alone, which was an extraordinary piece of
good fortune.</p>

<p>It was the first dog-watch. All the convicts
were in their prison quarters; a number
of sailors were smoking, idling, and talking in
the neighbourhood of the galleys; the wind
swept keen and hard athwart the forecastle;
and the sentry was the only figure that paced
that deck. Some rough chaff saluted me as I
passed the sailors. One asked if I was going
a-milking; another advised me to chuck the
bucket overboard and watch it tow. Just as
I was stepping up the forecastle ladder, Will,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
with a pipe in his mouth, put his head out of
his berth. He instantly saw me, and called
out, with the manner of a young fellow exercising
some little authority:</p>

<p>&#8216;Where are you taking that bucket to?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;On to the forecastle for water, sir,&#8217; I
answered.</p>

<p>&#8216;Do you know anything about rigging a
head pump?&#8217; he exclaimed. &#8216;Not you!&#8217; he
cried, laughing with a fine assumption of half-jocose,
half-pitying good nature. &#8216;Here, I&#8217;ll
show you what to do.&#8217;</p>

<p>He followed me up the ladder. Upon the
forecastle the wind was blowing with a great
roaring noise. The sentry leaned against it,
and his heavily coated figure swayed like a
scarecrow in a breezy field as he swung on
his gripping feet to the plunge and toss of the
bow. The surge, rent by the sheering cutwater,
rose in a boiling mass of whiteness to
within reach of the rail when the ship pitched.
The driven fabric swept the sea from her
weather bow in smoke, and at every stately
curtsey a vast sheet of foam washed many
fathoms ahead. The sea ridged dark and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span>
hard. The ship heeled sharply over under
great breasts of canvas, and from the forecastle
you saw the froth race past her on
either hand, and lift astern like a snow-covered
path.</p>

<p>&#8216;This was my chance and the first chance,
Marian,&#8217; said Will. &#8216;How are you getting on?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Well.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;We&#8217;ll seem to loiter a bit over this pump.
What are they going to do with you?&#8217;</p>

<p>I told him.</p>

<p>&#8216;What! Cuddy bottle-washer? And
the steward&#8217;s the cad of the ship. There are
many cads amongst us, but he&#8217;s head of the
clan here.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8217;m perfectly satisfied, Will. I wish I
could see Tom. I want to see him with my
own eyes.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Hold the bucket so,&#8217; said he, &#8216;and I&#8217;ll
pump. Oh, never mind the sentry. No
notice is taken of soldiers at this end of the
ship. I could hug you for your pluck, I
could. After all these days of black hole
under here to talk to the captain and doctor
as I heard you! Where do you sleep?&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>All this while he was pretending to work
the brake of the pump as though something
was wrong with it. I answered.</p>

<p>&#8216;Come, that&#8217;s good,&#8217; said he; &#8216;a cabin to
yourself! They couldn&#8217;t have given you
more had they charged you sixty guineas.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I have no mattress and nothing to sleep
on but the bunk-boards,&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;And no bedclothes, of course?&#8217; said he.</p>

<p>&#8216;The steward has promised me the loan of
a blanket if he can find one.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Leave me to see what I can do,&#8217; he exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8216;Run no risks, Will, for both our sakes.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Do you want your money, Marian?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;No, I was searched. If I produce money
now, they&#8217;ll guess I have a friend on board.
Will, there&#8217;s one thing you must contrive:
Let me have pencil and paper. Not now.
Wait for a better chance. There will be
plenty. I must write to him.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;How are you going to give him a letter?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8217;ll find a way, Will.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Marian, there&#8217;s no man under these stars,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
which are beginning to shine, who&#8217;s worth
what you&#8217;re doing for Tom. How cold the
wind blows! And aren&#8217;t they driving the old
bucket just! I know what it will be&mdash;eight
bells, and Balls&#8217;s infernal pipe, and an hour&#8217;s
roosting up amongst those boughs there to
reef and stow. You don&#8217;t want all that water
to wash in.&#8217;</p>

<p>He emptied two-thirds of the bucket, put
the strap into my hand, and we went down
the forecastle ladder. The steward, who was
helping the other man to lay the cloth, asked
what had kept me so long.</p>

<p>&#8216;The pump&#8217;s stiff,&#8217; said I, &#8216;and it blows
hard on the fo&#8217;c&#8217;sle.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Hard in your eye!&#8217; he exclaimed.
&#8216;Look lively now! There must be no
skulking. If you don&#8217;t bear a hand here, I&#8217;ll
send you forward to the bo&#8217;sun and the land
of ropes&#8217; ends and kicks.&#8217;</p>

<p>The under-steward laughed heartily. I
went briskly to my cabin, and washed my
face and hands as well as I could in the dark.
I found nothing in the steward&#8217;s language to
anger me&mdash;nothing in my situation to cause<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
me an instant&#8217;s regret. The truth is, I was
extraordinarily encouraged and supported by
the sense of my sex&mdash;by the thought that
I need but avow myself to become an object
of romantic interest, and so be, at all events,
humanely treated. Indeed, I caught myself
laughing when I put my hand into the upper
bunk to feel for the parcel of my wearing
apparel. What, I thought to myself, would
the steward think if I were to dress myself in
those clothes and enter the cuddy?</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXI<br />


<small>SHE ENTERS UPON HER DUTIES</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">I did</span> but little on this the first day of my
entering upon my strange new duties. The
steward distrusted my sea-legs, and he and
his mate fetched the dishes from the galley.
I hung about the fore-end of the cuddy, put
the dirty plates into the basket, collected the
knives and forks, went on errands to the
pantry and the like. The picture of the
cuddy was bright and hearty. Two large
illuminated globes, in silver holders, swung
under the ceiling; the light of them flashed
in the mirrors and rippled with the movements
of the ship in the polished woodwork.
The captain sat at the head of the table, the
doctor on his right. Captain Barrett and
Lieutenant Chimmo sat together on the other
side. Once or twice Captain Barrett screwed
his glass into his eye and looked at me, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
his gaze expressed no more than surprise to
find me at work as a cuddy-servant. The
others took not the least notice of me.</p>

<p>Captain Barrett had a loud laugh and a
hearty manner of speaking; Lieutenant
Chimmo was thin of voice, stilted and affected,
so stiff and snobbish as to satisfy me he was
not a born gentleman. I wondered to find
neither of the mates at the table, but I soon
discovered that it was the custom on board
the <i>Childe Harold</i> for the mate of the watch
to come below and eat after the captain was
done, the other two mates joining him when
possible, so as to make a separate table.</p>

<p>The talk at the beginning was not very
interesting. The convict guard, it seems, had
come to the ship from Chatham, and neither
Captain Barrett nor the lieutenant could say
too much in abuse of that place. There was
no society; dirt and drink formed the life of
the town. Deptford, nay even Sheerness, was
sweet and desirable compared to Chatham.
The doctor ate and drank water with a little
wine in it and seemed to listen. The captain
frequently lifted his eyes to the skylight as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
though thinking more of the weather than
of the officers&#8217; chatter. Presently Captain
Barrett, leaning across the table, said to the
doctor:</p>

<p>&#8216;Chimmo and I have been wondering
whether you&#8217;d have any objection, after the
fellow&#8217;s irons are knocked off, I mean, to
Barney Abram coming aft to give us a few
lessons in sparring? I dare say, captain,
your sailmaker could contrive to furnish out
an arrangement of canvas and oakum to
answer for boxing-gloves.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;It would be impossible to imagine any
objection stronger than mine to your suggestion,&#8217;
said the doctor.</p>

<p>&#8216;There&#8217;d be always a sentry at hand, you
know,&#8217; said Lieutenant Chimmo.</p>

<p>&#8216;Let us change the subject,&#8217; said the
doctor severely.</p>

<p>Captain Barrett looked at the doctor with
a slight sneer and said: &#8216;We&#8217;ll not talk of
bringing Barney Abram aft: we&#8217;ll talk of
Barney Abram as he is. Pity so much talent
should go wrong. Transport your felonious
clergy, attorneys, farmers, medical men,&#8217; he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
added, with a significant look at the doctor,
&#8216;there&#8217;d always then be too many to spare.
But to send such a prize-fighter as Barney
Abram out of the kingdom! To ship him
into a country where there&#8217;ll be nobody
to appreciate him! By Heaven, it&#8217;s as bad
as robbing the crown of England of a
jewel!&#8217;</p>

<p>The captain, observing that the doctor
did not like this talk, changed the subject by
speaking of the fine progress the ship was
making. At this moment I was sent to the
pantry by the steward. When I returned,
I heard Lieutenant Chimmo say: &#8216;What
would those chaps under hatches give for a
taste of that curried fowl! Your cook&#8217;s a
neat hand, captain.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;The provisions served out to the convicts
are infernally bad,&#8217; said Captain Barrett.</p>

<p>&#8216;&#8220;They are not good, but they may be
eaten,&#8221; as Charles XII. said to the soldier
who showed him some mouldy pieces of
bread,&#8217; exclaimed the doctor.</p>

<p>&#8216;At such a table as this,&#8217; said Lieutenant
Chimmo, &#8216;a man can take a philosophic view<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
of the tastes and appetites of people who are
ill-fed.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Convicts are as well fed as sailors,&#8217; said
Captain Sutherland.</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8217;d rather be a convict than a sailor,&#8217;
said Captain Barrett.</p>

<p>&#8216;One&#8217;s t&#8217;other more often than not,&#8217;
observed Lieutenant Chimmo. &#8216;&#8217;Stonishing
what a lot of rascals sail afore the mast!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Take care that whisper don&#8217;t get forward
of the main-hatch sentry,&#8217; said the captain,
with a glance at the steward. &#8216;Jack&#8217;s got a
sensitive side to his nature.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Doctor, what&#8217;s to be the routine when
decent weather sets in?&#8217; inquired Captain
Barrett.</p>

<p>&#8216;Schools, Bible classes, and frequent
prayer-meetings, sir,&#8217; answered the doctor.</p>

<p>&#8216;Don&#8217;t educate them,&#8217; said Lieutenant
Chimmo. &#8216;They&#8217;re very bad now; education&#8217;ll
make them worse.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8217;m with Chimmo,&#8217; said Captain Barrett.
&#8216;Doctor, I&#8217;ll wager you what you will that
the worst of your people are those who are
most intelligent and best educated.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span>The doctor made no answer.</p>

<p>&#8216;I must state this as a fact,&#8217; said Captain
Sutherland, with a side look at the doctor,
as though distrusting his topic: &#8216;Mr. Bates,
my chief officer, recognised one of the
convicts. His name&mdash;&#8217; The doctor made a
motion with his hand. &#8216;Well, enough if I
say,&#8217; exclaimed the captain, stammering, &#8216;that
this same man is a person of excellent antecedents,
was for years at sea, and held several
posts of trust, and finally wound up a flourishing
career by investing his savings in a smart
little barque for no other purpose than to
scuttle her that he might pocket about triple
the amount of his venture in insurance
money.&#8217;</p>

<p>I heard this, and my heart turned hot.
I longed to walk up to Captain Sutherland,
look him in the eyes, and call him a beast and
a liar. No one observed me, which was
lucky. I was conscious that my face worked
with agitation and that my cheeks were red
with the blood which the captain&#8217;s lie had
driven into my head. At this point the
steward bade me carry a basket of dirty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
dishes to the galley, and I stepped out with
my burden upon the quarter-deck.</p>

<p>The evening was black and the wind wet,
and it swept athwart the bulwark-rail with a
shriek and a bite of frost. Over the lee-rail
the seas ran from the ship in pale, cloudy
heaps. Occasionally the brine lashed the
forecastle like a showering of small shot, and
again and again you&#8217;d feel the blow of a sea
on the bow striking the ship before she could
rise, and the white water of it was flashed
back into the dark wind, though the hissing
body came like a thunder-squall, an instant
later, soaking the decks till the scuppers
sobbed again.</p>

<p>I staggered along with the basket of
crockery, and passing the sentry, slipped
and slid forward through the convicts&#8217; inclosure
till I came to the ship&#8217;s galley. A
number of seamen were gathered under the
lee of this place. The red fire of the stove
illuminated the fat figure of the cook as he
stood pointing a piece of paper to the flame
of the lamp to light his pipe. Another
fellow was busy at a kind of dresser. Against<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
the closed weather-door leaned the boatswain
with folded arms and an inverted pipe betwixt
his lips. It was a hot, snug, mellow
interior to look in upon after the cheerless
scene of the decks and the leaning and waving
heights of dim canvas above.</p>

<p>&#8216;So they&#8217;ve found work for you, hey?&#8217;
said the boatswain, giving me a large nod.
&#8216;Yet you&#8217;d better ha&#8217; stopped at home.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Who&#8217;s this?&#8217; said the cook.</p>

<p>&#8216;The youngster as I found rolled up in a
spare t&#8217;gallan&#8217;s&#8217;l,&#8217; answered the boatswain.
&#8216;They&#8217;re a-going to keep him in the land o&#8217;
knives and forks.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;And you&#8217;d rather be a waiter than a
steward, Joey?&#8217; said the cook with a greasy
chuckle. &#8216;I don&#8217;t blame you. It&#8217;s all night
in with us idlers, and a warm blanket&#8217;s
better than a lee earing, ain&#8217;t it, Mr. Balls?
But what&#8217;s brought the covey to ship in this
here convick barge?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What ha&#8217; you got there?&#8217; said the
fellow at the dresser.</p>

<p>&#8216;Dirty plates,&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>This man, who was the cook&#8217;s mate, who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
had but one eye, and whose cast of face was
certainly more villainous than any of the
felons I had watched taking their exercise
that day, put his head out of the galley-door,
and exclaimed: &#8216;Fire that there steward!
Here&#8217;s a gallus look out o&#8217; dishes! If that
there perishin&#8217; Stiles could foul six plates
&#8217;stead o&#8217; wan he&#8217;d do&#8217;t to spite me.&#8217; He continued
to grumble hideously, and I backed
away from his ugly tongue and uglier face
and walked toward the cuddy, but slowly,
and holding on as I went, for the decks were
steep and greasy and the ship was taking the
seas in quick, angry jumps.</p>

<p>As I passed through the quarter-deck
barricade my elbow was touched, and Will
accosted me.</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8217;m going to bounce a mattress out of the
steward for you, Marian,&#8217; said he, &#8216;but as no
more lies than can be helped must be told,
follow me.&#8217;</p>

<p>I accompanied him up the lee poop-ladder.
He led me a little way along the deck and
then crossed it to where a man was standing
under the shelter of one of the quarter-boats.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>&#8216;Here&#8217;s this stowaway lad asked me to
help him to a mattress, sir,&#8217; he exclaimed.
&#8216;They&#8217;ve given him a bunk in the steerage,
but there&#8217;s nothing in it to lie upon.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;He deserves the cat for hiding aboard
us,&#8217; answered the man, who was indeed Mr.
Bates, the first mate. &#8216;What have they put
him to, d&#8217;ye know, Johnstone?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;He&#8217;s cuddy bottle-washer, sir.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What&#8217;s brought you to sea, you young
fool?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I want to get to Tasmania, sir.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Why didn&#8217;t you concern yourself in some
riot, or turn Irish politician; they&#8217;d have
clothed and bedded and fed and sent you
across handsomely, and perhaps have fitted
you with a good berth ashore at the end; instead,
you start as a sneak, and, no doubt,
you&#8217;ll come home as a sneak. Mattress&mdash;mattress&mdash;I&#8217;ve
got nothing to do with that.
Shift for yourself and be off.&#8217;</p>

<p>I went on to the quarter-deck, wondering
what on earth Will meant by taking me to
the mate, as though to provoke him to abuse
me. Before I entered the cuddy my cousin<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
was at my elbow. You will remember that it
was very dark and nobody but the sentry was
on the quarter-deck.</p>

<p>&#8216;It&#8217;s all right,&#8217; said he eagerly. &#8216;I&#8217;ll
manage it now. Wait a bit. You must have
a bed to lie on, you know. Don&#8217;t take to
heart what the mate says. It&#8217;s his duty to
growl at you, but as a man he&#8217;s sound to the
heels.&#8217;</p>

<p>They were still at table in the cuddy. It
was hard to realise that the vessel was a prison-ship
when you looked at this bright, rich interior,
with its soft yellow lamps flashing
under the skylights and the looking-glasses
reduplicating the sparkling and hospitable furniture
of the table. It was like passing from
another state of life to enter this brightness
and warmth from the wet and nipping blackness
outside, with the grim, dark figure of the
sentry, the barricades, the blackness and
silence of the sentinelled main-hatch.</p>

<p>The steward sent me to the pantry to wash
glasses, and I went with his assistant, a fellow
named Franz or Frank, a young German. I
had not before known him for a German; I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
believe I had not heard him speak. He was
a freckled, ginger-coloured man, as expressionless
of face as an oyster. But he was good-tempered
and willing, and when we were in
the pantry washing glasses he said that he
hoped we should be friends. I answered it
would not be my fault if we were not good
friends. On this he shook hands with me and
asked if I was ever in Germany. He wished
to know why I had stowed myself away in
this convict ship and if I had friends in
Tasmania.</p>

<p>&#8216;I need not have hidden,&#8217; said I. &#8216;My
friends are well-to-do.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Dot I can believe,&#8217; said he, polishing a
tumbler and closing one eye while he held it
to the lamp. &#8216;You vhas a young gentleman.
Dot I hear in your voice. Maybe you vhas
more of a gentleman dan some dot ve vaits on.
How do you like Mr. Stiles?&#8217; naming the
steward.</p>

<p>&#8216;He is a funny man.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;How vhas he funny?&#8217; said he.</p>

<p>&#8216;He made you laugh heartily when he
talked to me.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>&#8216;Dot vhas to please him. For my part&mdash;&mdash;&#8217;
He shrugged his shoulders. He then inquired
if I had agreed for any wages, and expressed
sorrow that we were not to share a berth. &#8216;I
likes to make you my chum&mdash;dot is der verdt&mdash;whilst
ve vhas togedder.&#8217;</p>

<p>Presently the steward called to us, and
when I entered the cuddy I found Mr. Bates
at table and the captain and officers gone.
Mr. Bates was very quick with his dinner.
He had charge of the deck. I believe he was
not above ten minutes in despatching his meal.
He took no notice of me. When he was
gone, I helped the two stewards to strip the
table, and whilst this was doing Will Johnstone
put his head in at the cuddy door and called
to the steward.</p>

<p>&#8216;There&#8217;s some spare convicts&#8217; mattresses
stowed away aft,&#8217; said he, in the peremptory
voice of the sea. &#8216;You&#8217;re to let Marlowe have
one; and throw in a couple of the convicts&#8217;
blankets for his use. D&#8217;ye hear me, steward?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes, I hear you, young gentleman,&#8217; answered
the steward. &#8216;But who sent me that
bit of noose?&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>Will, however, had backed a step and disappeared
in the blackness.</p>

<p>&#8216;The order comes from Mr. Bates, I expect,&#8217;
said I. &#8216;I stepped on to the poop
some time since, to see if he&#8217;d let me have a
mattress.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Well, pink me if you was behind the door
when cheek was sarved out,&#8217; said the steward.
&#8216;Did he offer to throw you overboard?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;He asked me many questions. Mr. Bates
seems one of the kindest-hearted of men.&#8217;</p>

<p>The steward stared at me for a moment,
muttered to himself, and then, with something
of an agitated hand, proceeded in his work of
stripping the table. However, Will&#8217;s ruse, or
&#8216;bounce,&#8217; as he had called it, proved successful.
Mr. Stiles, of course, supposed that the
apprentice had come with direct instructions;
and when he had cleared the table he took
me into the steerage and, opening a cabin
door, held up a lantern and bade me choose a
mattress. A number of convicts&#8217; mattresses
lay stowed here, every one with a little pillow
attached to it, and every one was numbered,
as though as a provision for a larger assemblage<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
of miscreants than had been shipped. Here,
also, were two or three bales of spare blankets,
to a couple of which I helped myself; and
now, thanks to Will, I had a bed to lie on and
clothes to cover me.</p>

<p>In my own berth, as I may call it, I said to
the steward, pointing to the bundle in the
upper bunk: &#8216;That can be left there. It will
not be in the way.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What is it?&#8217; said he. &#8216;Oh, it was brought
aboard just afore we started, and the captain
gave it to me, thinking it might belong to some
of the soldiers or their wives as&#8217;d presently be
claiming it. It&#8217;s a herror,&#8217; said he, looking at
the parcel, &#8216;though the name of this vessel&#8217;s
wrote big enough for a monkey to read without
glasses. Let it lie. It&#8217;s out of the ways
here.&#8217; Then, looking around him, he lost his
temper. &#8216;Here&#8217;s a pretty go!&#8217; he cried. &#8216;To
think of a Woolwich stowaway berthed in such
a beautiful bedroom as this here! It&#8217;s a-flying
in the face of right, and it&#8217;s a-courting and
caressing of wickedness to make any one as
has done wrong so comfortable. If this gets
wind, suffocate me if stowaways won&#8217;t breed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
thick as fleas in vessels&#8217; holds! But you&#8217;ll
have to work.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8217;ll work, and work well,&#8217; said I, smiling;
&#8216;and as you treat me so shall your reward be.&#8217;</p>

<p>He held the lantern to my face and said:
&#8216;Where?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Hobart Town.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;There&#8217;s no use a-dangling that sort of fly,&#8217;
said he; &#8216;I&#8217;m no one-eyed fish. When I rise,
it&#8217;s to summat juicy, with ne&#8217;er a hook in its
inside. Never you mind about Hobart Town,
but turn to and get your supper.&#8217;</p>

<p>I went to the pantry, where I found Frank.
We supped off a dish that had come from the
cabin table. Frank informed me that had the
captain sent me to live before the mast, I
should never have beheld or tasted such a
dish even in my dreams. &#8216;They starfs you,&#8217;
said he; &#8216;pork dot vhas deadt of der measles,
und beef dot vhas a horse until dey salt her
down into casks.&#8217; Again he endeavoured to
ascertain who I was and what I meant to do
on my arrival in Hobart Town. He said, if
my connections were flourishing people, he&#8217;d
be very grateful if I&#8217;d put in a good word for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
him. He was not born to this sort of life;
he had seen better days, wrote a good hand,
and could correspond in three tongues. He
had signed articles for the round voyage, but
was ready to run from the ship if a chance
offered.</p>

<p>I looked mysterious and smiled knowingly,
and said I guessed that when my friends
heard my story they would be glad to do a
kindness to any one who had proved a friend
to me during the passage. He put oil into
my cabin-lamp and showed me how to trim it,
and assured me that any little conveniences
which he possessed were at my service. I
learned that my work ended at nine. At half-past
eight, the materials for grog were placed
upon the cabin table, and at two bells I was
at liberty to go to bed.</p>

<p>&#8216;But you&#8217;ll understand,&#8217; said the steward,
who gave me this information, &#8216;that if all &#8217;ands
is called you must turn out. It&#8217;ll be for me
to sing down the hatch &#8220;All &#8217;ands,&#8221; and you
don&#8217;t stop to dress, but rush up, for you&#8217;re
never to know what hawful things ain&#8217;t on the
heve of &#8217;appening when that loud cry of &#8220;All<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
&#8217;ands&#8221; rings through such a big ship as this,
and if you don&#8217;t turn out, then of course you&#8217;ll
be one of them parties as feel sorry for themselves
next day.&#8217;</p>

<p>When two bells were struck I went into
the recess under the poop to take a look at
the labouring ship and the dark night before
going to bed. The canvas had been reefed
at eight o&#8217;clock; at that hour, and for
some time after, I had heard the wild
hoarse notes of sailors singing out at the
ropes, and the cannonading of heavy sails
whose released halyards had abandoned the
slack canvas to the thrashing gale. The ship
was rushing along her course, climbing the
high seas and whitening out the water till the
seething waves gleamed like moonlight round
about her. Captain Barrett and the doctor
were playing at chess in the cuddy; the
subaltern looked on with a paper cigar drooping
at his mouth. All seemed dark and at
rest down the hatch where the soldiers&#8217;
quarters were. I thought to myself if this
ship were to strike another and founder, what
chance for their lives would the two hundred<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
and thirty men below have, lying, for all I
knew, in their irons, so battened down that
nothing short of an explosion could lift the
hatch for them.</p>

<p>A figure approached and peered in my
face; the cabin lamp-light was upon him;
it was Will.</p>

<p>&#8216;Is that you?&#8217; said he doubtfully.</p>

<p>On my replying, he put his hand into his
pocket and gave me a little parcel. &#8216;Here&#8217;s
a pencil and paper for you, Marian,&#8217; said he.
&#8216;Be mighty careful in writing, and don&#8217;t
mention my name. You can&#8217;t be too cautious.
The sentries&#8217; eyes are as keen as their bayonets.
Have you a mattress?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Why don&#8217;t you go to bed?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I am off in a minute.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;This is no place for you. I wish you
were at home in Stepney.&#8217; He went on to
the poop, and I descended to my berth.</p>

<small>SHE SEES HER SWEETHEART</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> convict mattress was hard, and the
pillow was hard, and the blankets as coarse
as manufacture could contrive; yet I would
not have exchanged them for my own soft
bed and linen at home. I was now sleeping
as Tom did: I was on board a convict ship
as he was; and some of the company I should
be forced to keep were scarcely less rough
than the felons below. I should be doing
work by day almost as hard, perhaps, as Tom
would be put to; I was, therefore, not only
hand in hand with my love in the sympathy
of suffering, I was bearing almost as heavy
a burden as weighed upon him; and even
his degradation was as much mine as though
I, too, were a convict, for he was my sweetheart,
and one day, God willing, would be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
my husband, and whatever touched him
touched me as though we had been one.</p>

<p>These were my thoughts as I pulled the
convict blankets over me and put my head
upon the little, hard, convict pillow, and lay
for a while listening to the torrent of foam
that thundered past the porthole. I then fell
asleep, and my sleep was deep and dreamless
as death, so exhausted was I; and when I
awoke, the cabin was glimmering out to the
light of the newly-broken morning, and I
beheld the young man Frank standing beside
me.</p>

<p>He told me it was time to turn out; the
steward was calling for me; there was the
cabin deck to scrub and the cuddy to be
got ready for breakfast.</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8217;ll follow you in an instant,&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;Do you know,&#8217; said he, going to the door,
&#8216;dot you vhas very goodt-looking? It vhas
lucky you hov goodt teeth, you show them
even in your sleep. I sometimes belief I
must hov seen your sister. But hov you a
sister?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;No,&#8217; said I, rubbing my eyes and troubled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
by these questions, and wishing he would
go.</p>

<p>&#8216;Vell, I vhas a waiter for two or three
months at the Brunswick Hotel in der East
India Docks, and I remember a handsome
young lady dot came in once or twice in dot
time. She vhas so much like you she might
easily hov been your sister.&#8217;</p>

<p>He went out when he had said this. I
had no time to reflect, but certainly I had
found no air of suspicion in his manner. It
took me but a minute to plunge my face in
cold water and go out, having lain down for
warmth, fully dressed, save my cap and shoes.
On showing myself, the steward told me to
get a bucket and go on the poop and fetch
water from the pump, which the apprentices
and some ordinary seamen were washing
down the deck by.</p>

<p>I mounted the companion-ladder and found
the morning brightening into sunshine. The
sea in the east was radiant with sliding hills
of silver; the sky was a delicate azure, high,
with small feather-shaped clouds linked like
lacework. Passing us at the distance of a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
mile was a large ship with flags flying. She
was bowing the sea somewhat heavily, and
made a noble picture as she crushed the
brine into snow under her massive forefoot,
yielding to the surge till the line of her green
copper showed with a long, wet flash, whilst
the soft whiteness of her canvas ran trembling
in shadows to her trucks with her tossing,
where it blended with the feather-shaped
clouds, so that you could scarce tell one from
another.</p>

<p>Our own ship was clothed with sail to the
royal yards, with dark lines of damp where
the reefs had been lately shaken out. I was
too far aft to see the main-deck. Smoke
from the chimneys of the two galleys blew
black and brisk over the bow, showing that
the wind nearly followed us. The sailors
were washing down, the head pump was
going, and buckets were being handed along
from the forecastle, where stood the sentry in
a grey coat with his bayonet gleaming like
silver. The first person I saw on the poop
was my cousin Will. He and several others
were scrubbing the deck hard with brushes,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
whilst a broad-shouldered apprentice flung
pailfuls of water along the planks. Will
turned his head and saw me, but took no
further notice. Mr. Bates, the chief mate,
stood near the wheel, and I observed that he
watched me whilst I filled my bucket at the
little pump that was kept a-gushing by an
active young seaman. It was a strange real
picture of shipboard life on the high seas.
The cold of the night was still in the wind,
and not yet had the sun extinguished the
melancholy of the gray dawn in the distant
recesses of the west.</p>

<p>I saw no convict, but when I returned to
the cuddy with my bucket full of water, on
looking through the windows which commanded
a view of the main-deck, I observed
a number of the felons all hard at work
brushing, swabbing and cleaning. For an
hour I worked with Frank, scrubbing the
cuddy deck, drying it, replacing the lengths
of carpet and so on. The steward then told
me to get a hook-pot from the pantry and go
to the galley for some hot coffee for Frank
and myself. I found a hook-pot and stepped<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
on to the quarter-deck, meaning to walk
forward by the narrow gangway; but a
number of seamen on some job there blocked
it, so I went past the sentry at the barricade
gate.</p>

<p>I was trembling, and felt myself pale.
There were many convicts about, and any one
at a moment might turn and prove to be
Tom. Some were coiling ropes away, some
slapped the deck with swabs, some were
cleaning the paintwork; they were all ironed.
The decks, dark with brine, were greasy, the
motions of the ship quick and uncomfortable,
and the irons, robbing the limbs of all elasticity,
caused many of the unhappy wretches to slide
and stagger as they moved about, for which
they would be sharply and sometimes brutally
yelled at by the convicts who overseered them.
The prize-fighter was savagely swabbing near
the main-hatch. He struck the deck as
though he would split it. I was obliged to
pass him close. He saw me and nodded, and
said in a low, thick, sarcastic voice, &#8216;Dice
work to put a gentlebud to.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Attend to what you&#8217;re about there!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>&#8217;
roared a man on the other side of the
deck.</p>

<p>I pushed on. A convict stood at the
ship&#8217;s side, coiling a rope over a pin. His
face was averted, but as I neared him he
moved his head to look in the direction of the
poop. It was Tom. Our eyes met. He did
not know me and turned his gaze away, then
looked again, then stared as if paralysed.
His hands were arrested as though he had
been struck dead; his face whitened to the
complexion of death. I brushed past him
close, saying in a low voice, but distinctly,
&#8216;Tom, dearest, it is Marian. We are together
and shall yet be happy,&#8217; and so saying I went
on without again looking and entered the
ship&#8217;s galley.</p>

<p>But the sudden encounter, seeing him in
irons, so affected me that I could scarcely
draw my breath. I noticed with a pang of
exquisite distress that he looked ill; his complexion
an unhealthy white, his cheeks sunk,
his eyes hollow and leaden. When I was in
the galley I stood struggling to get my breath
before attempting to speak; then I heard a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
commotion outside. The stout cook pushed
past me, and, putting his head through the
galley-door, cried, after staring a few moments:
&#8216;Blowed if it don&#8217;t look as if the poor
chap was dying!&#8217;</p>

<p>I sprang through the door and saw Tom
supported by two or three convicts. He lay
in their arms in the posture of a man lifted
on to his feet but unable to stand. In a
minute or two he struggled and stood erect,
and I heard him say: &#8216;There, lads, I thank
you. Just a passing faintness. Take no more
heed of me;&#8217; and, picking up the rope, he
continued in his task of coiling it over the
pin. I watched him coil a second rope away
and then re-entered the galley.</p>

<p>&#8216;I wonder them coves ain&#8217;t a-fainting
every hour,&#8217; said the cook, as he filled my
hook-pot with hot coffee. &#8216;No grog and no
baccy! Think of that; and a vindier diet
than fo&#8217;c&#8217;sle allowance. Burgoo may be good
eating for them as thinks the bagpipes good
music; but you may take it from me, my lad,
that it ain&#8217;t the sort of stuff for a growed-up
man to go to bed on. There&#8217;s too much sop<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
a-going in prison fare. A gent who&#8217;s brought
himself up for years on champagne, salmon,
and the best of eating, signs the wrong name
to a bit of paper and&#8217;s put aboard a ship like
this, where he gets nothen to eat but cocoa
and ship&#8217;s beef and burgoo. Can the likes of
such men help fainting? Ask yourself. I
dessey the covey as swounded just now was
a nob in his way before he was took. There&#8217;s
no telling who&#8217;s who down below. Out of
the road now, my lively! Here&#8217;s the sailors
a-coming for their tea.&#8217;</p>

<p>I got into the narrow gangway and so
made my way aft that I might not again pass
Tom. My dread was for myself rather than
for him. If I drew close and once more
looked him in the face, my passion of love
must vent itself in some desperate betraying
manner. Girl as I was, I found a curse in
my heart for the barbarity that weighted my
sweetheart&#8217;s ankles with iron, and a curse for
the law that had suffered two villains to swear
his liberty, fortune, happiness away and make
a broken-hearted convict of him.</p>

<p>I drank a little coffee in the pantry with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
my fellow-servant, but ate nothing. The
German supposed I was fretting over having
run away and good-naturedly tried to cheer
me. However, as the time passed, my spirits
improved, for now I knew beyond all doubt
that Tom was on board; and he also knew
beyond all doubt that I was with him, and it
comforted me to reflect that without any further
explanation he would understand why I
had made no attempt to bid him farewell at
Woolwich.</p>

<p>And still I was anxious. He would soon
discover, by observing me as I passed to and
fro, that I had been put to menial work unfit
for the lady of his love, for the girl of his
heart, for a woman who had been greatly
indulged, who knew nothing of hardships,
whose means were ample for one of her
degree. I feared his spirit would chafe and
fret over the thought of my being a common
helper in the cabin&mdash;cuddy-deck scrubber, a
ship&#8217;s scullery boy&mdash;and that to deliver me
from these degrading offices he might betray
me, tell the story of our love, and exactly
reveal my condition, not doubting, I dare say,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
that Captain Sutherland would then charge
me for my passage and treat me as a passenger.
And, indeed, I should have been very willing
to be a passenger, to pay any exorbitant sum
for that privilege, had the thing been contrivable
now that I was on board. But could it
have been managed? No. Because whether
I revealed myself as a woman with a secret
which nothing could make her avow, or
whether I owned my sex and frankly declared
that I had followed Tom because of my love
for him, in either case the stern and suspicious
doctor would either oblige me to land at any
port we had occasion to water at, or compel
the captain to pass me into the first ship that
would receive me.</p>

<p>I found an opportunity after the cuddy
breakfast things had been cleared away to
write a letter to Tom. I wrote in my cabin
and used the pencil and paper my cousin had
given to me. Whilst I wrote I had not felt
so tranquil in spirits, so easy, nay, so happy
in my heart, for months. Tom was near me.
Nothing but death or ocean calamity could
separate us till we arrived at Tasmania, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
then I should be in the same land with him,
with opportunities that I could not now imagine;
this writing was like talking to him,
and the sweeter because it was secret; no
governor would first read my letter.</p>

<p>I wrote very small, in pencil, that I might
put much into narrow compass. I told him
of the arrangements I had made before leaving
home, why I had dressed as a boy, why I had
hidden myself in this convict ship instead of
following by a passenger vessel. I gave him
my reasons for desiring to continue as a boy,
and wound up by begging him to keep up
his heart, to be sure we should be happy yet
in the new land, and I implored him to feel
easy as to my situation, my duties being light,
my berth comfortable, and my associates civil
and obliging.</p>

<p>I folded this letter into the smallest square
I could pack it into, and put it into my waistcoat
pocket ready to convey to Tom at some
such another opportunity as had befallen that
morning. But as it turned out, the weather
changed that day, and for four successive
days it blew hard, with incessant rain, which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
often flashed in whole sheets of water betwixt
the reeling masts, and not a convict appeared
on deck except the messmen at meal-times to
pass the food below.</p>

<p>During one of these wet and howling
days, when the ship, under small canvas, was
swinging over the hills of pallid water, I stood
in the recess under the break of the poop.
My work was done; I had stepped out to
look at the ship before going to bed. The
vessel rushed through the night in darkness,
and the night itself lay black as ink around
the sea with a little faintness over our mastheads
as though there was a moon there. I
was about to go to bed, when Will came off
the poop and, distinguishing me in the light
that lay on the cuddy windows, he screwed
himself into a dark corner, and called. I
went down the slope of deck.</p>

<p>&#8216;I have been talking about you to the
chief mate,&#8217; said he. &#8216;I have told him that
by an accident I have found out who you are.
I said your mother&#8217;s name was Marlowe, and
that your father, in his life, was a client of
my father&#8217;s. Mr. Bates supposes that your<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
mother married a cousin of her own name.
I told him I knew that you were thoroughly
respectable, and that you had left your home
because your stepfather led you a dog&#8217;s
life.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What was the good of your telling him
all this?&#8217; said I, feeling very angry, though
I controlled myself. &#8216;But I know how it&#8217;ll
end. You&#8217;ll talk and talk till you betray me,
and then that odious doctor will take the first
opportunity to turn me out of the ship. All
that I have suffered and passed through will
go for nothing, and I shall lose sight of Tom,
and perhaps be separated from him for ever,&#8217;
and now I felt as if I must cry.</p>

<p>&#8216;Don&#8217;t talk like a fool,&#8217; said Will; &#8216;I&#8217;m
not going to betray you. I want to go on
helping you as I helped you from the start,
but as I ought never to have helped you.
How are you going to get any clothes?
Think! Don&#8217;t talk of the slop-chest. You&#8217;re
not on the articles. There&#8217;ll not be a farthing
coming to you. You&#8217;ve been searched, and,
as you said yourself, it&#8217;s out of the question
you should produce money now. Will the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
captain trust a stowaway? Of course not.
So there&#8217;s no slop-chest so far as you&#8217;re concerned.
Yet how long d&#8217;ye think those
clothes of yours are going to hang upon your
body, scrubbing and messing about in them
as you are all day long? And when wear
has turned them into Irish pennants, what
are you going to do for a shift of duds?
Why, you must come to me, of course. But
how can I help you if I don&#8217;t know you in
some such a way as to justify me in taking
an interest in you? Now do you see what I
would be at?&#8217; cried he, giving me a soft,
playful chuck under the chin.</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes, I understand now. I ask your
pardon. You are clever and look ahead.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Well, that&#8217;s all right,&#8217; said he; &#8216;and now
I shall be able to give you a shift of linen and
to mostly rig you out. Most of what&#8217;s in my
chest was given to me by you. Nobody can
say a word when it&#8217;s understood that your
father was a client of the old man&#8217;s. It&#8217;ll
raise you in the general esteem, also. So,
say what you will, I&#8217;ve done you a good turn
this blessed night. And now get to bed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
away out of this filthy yowling. Look how
sweetly it rains! And I&#8217;ve still three hours to
stand!&#8217;</p>

<p>With that he made a spring on to the
poop-ladder and disappeared.</p>

<small>SHE VISITS THE BARRACKS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">I have</span> said that this passage of wet, violent
weather lasted about four days. On the
morning of the fourth day of it the steward
sent me to the galley on some errand I forget
the nature of. The cook was wild with
temper. Everything seemed to have gone
wrong with him. The baker had offered to
fight him for his day&#8217;s allowance of rum.
He had scalded himself, besides, during an
unusually heavy lurch. When I looked in
on him he swore and told me to wait. It was
all the same to me. It had ceased to rain,
and I stood under the lee of the galley for
shelter from the wind.</p>

<p>It was a grey, dark, dismal, roaring day.
The seas rolled in hills of green, and the foam
of them, as their heads broke, was blown high
up in white smoke. The ship looked strained<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
aloft. Her lee rigging and gear were arched
out by the gale; the bands of topsails were
dusky with wet, and the wind screamed like
children flying in terror. The barricades gave
the ship a most miserable appearance. The
decks sobbed with the ceaseless soaking, and
the white water flashed inboards through the
scupper-holes wherever the vessel buried her
lee side. At the far end of the poop was the
helmsman, sharply rising and falling against
the whirling soot of the sky. The officer of
the watch, clothed in oilskins, stood grasping
a stay near a quarter-boat. A single sentry
stood at the head of the poop-ladder. The
poor fellow was sodden, and seemed withered
by the ceaseless pouring of the blast. One
cannot but feel sorry for soldiers at sea. The
forecastle sentry looked equally wretched.
Those on the main-deck were in some degree
sheltered by the weather bulwarks. A
strange smell of cattle, hay, poultry, and pigs,
came from the long-boat, within and under
which the live-stock were stowed. A dismal,
wet, roaring, frost-cold picture. The melancholy
horror of it is upon my spirits as I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
talk to you, and yet this was but the first week
of what might prove a passage of months.</p>

<p>I heard the boatswain&#8217;s voice of thunder
giving orders to some seamen on the other side
of the galley. Presently he came round to
my side of the deck, and on seeing me called
out, &#8216;I&#8217;ve got some o&#8217; your property. The
chief mate says I&#8217;m to hand it over to you.
Here&#8217;s the handkerchief,&#8217; said he. &#8216;There
was two pipes. Well, I can&#8217;t return &#8217;em
because they&#8217;re broke. Here&#8217;s yer tinder-box
and arrangement, and a pretty contrivance it
is. When I get ashore I shall ask my young
woman to make me a present of such
another.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;You are very welcome to it, Mr. Balls.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Say you so? Smite me if I haven&#8217;t been
swearing you was a gentleman born and bred
ever since I first lugged you out of the
t&#8217;garns&#8217;l. Well, I&#8217;m truly obliged. As pretty
a little&mdash;&mdash;&#8217; and he walked off, talking aloud
as he looked at the tinder-box.</p>

<p>I heard the cook speaking with great
excitement to his mate, and guessed that I
should do well to keep quiet until he told me<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
that he was ready. A few minutes later a
soldier&#8217;s wife rose through the hatch near the
cuddy-front&mdash;they called it the booby-hatch&mdash;and
came forward. She had a shawl over
her head, and was bringing a pudding to the
cook to be baked. A sudden heave of the
ship drove her against the lee bulwarks. I
went to her help, took the dish from her, and
put it into her hands again when we had
reached the galley. She was the pretty young
wife who had before taken notice of me with
smiles. The cook spoke insolently to her&mdash;asked
her if she thought he&#8217;d shipped to do
nothing but look after such small mucking
jobs of barracks pastry as that there. He
wasn&#8217;t &#8216;no blushen&#8217; soldiers&#8217; cook.&#8217; If it
depended upon him there&#8217;d be no army.
&#8216;What! Keep a scaldin&#8217; lot o&#8217; gutterpeckers
in money, good wittles, and fine clothes at the
expense of the nation, whose sailors has to do
all the real fighting when it comes to it?&#8217; He
said much in this way, shouting loudly, and
sticking and thrusting and gesticulating with
a long, dangerous-looking fork used for bringing
up the meat out of the coppers. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
woman threatened to fetch the sergeant. The
cook, with a horrid laugh, begged her to lose
no time. His coppers were ready, he said,
and he&#8217;d warrant the sergeant boiled to a turn
before four bells. After more of this Mr.
Cook took the dish from the woman, eyed and
smelled it, with a sarcastic leer, and requested
the woman to clear out.</p>

<p>She stood at my side, breathing short, and
very angry and flushed, and said if she told
her husband of the cook&#8217;s behaviour he would
kill him. I advised her to take no notice of
the fellow. All sea cooks in a gale of wind
were bad-tempered to a proverb. They had
much to put up with. Only think of being
forced to cook in a kitchen that was continually
rolling about, saucepans sliding, sea-water
bursting in, hungry sailors, with knives in
their hands, full of threats and oaths if time
was not punctually kept. I put the case
humorously, and she began to laugh and to
peep at me with her bright eyes.</p>

<p>She asked me what I waited for, and, one
thing leading to another, she seemed in no
hurry to quit me. And, indeed, we stood<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
very snug, warm, and sheltered under the lee
of the galley. We got upon the subject of the
quarters below.</p>

<p>&#8216;What sort of barracks have you?&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;Come down and see them when you can,&#8217;
said she.</p>

<p>&#8216;Whom must I apply to for permission?&#8217;
said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;You&#8217;ll want no permission, I believe,&#8217; she
answered. &#8216;You belong to the ship. But I&#8217;ll
speak to my husband, and the sergeant&#8217;ll make
no difficulty.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I should like to see the convicts&#8217; quarters,&#8217;
said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;You&#8217;ll be able to get a peep at them
through the door in the steerage bulkhead. I
may be able to manage that for you, too,&#8217; said
she. &#8216;Dick has sentry there for some time
to-day. If you&#8217;ll stop here, I&#8217;ll find out at
once, and come back and tell you the hour.&#8217;</p>

<p>I thanked her, earnestly hoping that the
hour would fit in with my duties. Before she
returned the cook was ready for me. I went
toward the cuddy, and as I passed the booby-hatch
the soldier&#8217;s wife came up.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>&#8216;You&#8217;re welcome to step below whenever
you please,&#8217; said she. &#8216;The sergeant&#8217;s got an
eye upon you and wants to &#8217;list you,&#8217; she
added, laughing. &#8216;And a sweet young soldier
you&#8217;d make&mdash;a heart-breaker, indeed,&#8217; said
she, looking at me with a shake of the head.
&#8216;Dick&#8217;s on sentry at twelve. If that&#8217;ll suit,
come then. He&#8217;ll take no notice whilst you
look.&#8217;</p>

<p>Twelve was the very hour I would have
named. It was my dinner-hour, and I had a
clear half-hour at the very least before helping
to prepare the cuddy luncheon. When eight
bells struck I came to the hatch, but warily.
The doctor was talking to the captain at the
after-end of the cuddy, and I did not mean
that either of them should see where I was
going. It still blew hard, and was very thick,
and the officers were unable to get an observation
of the sun. I stooped, that the two
men in the cuddy might lose sight of me. By
the looks of the sentry at the quarter-deck
barricade I guessed he knew that I was going
to pay his quarters a visit, and that it was all
right. But I cared not who saw me descend<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
unless it were the officers of the ship and
guard.</p>

<p>I put my foot over and easily went down
an almost perpendicular ladder. I found myself
in a somewhat strange interior. On the
right, or starboard, hand was a long cabin,
which Will afterwards told me had been designed
for a midshipman&#8217;s berth. This cabin
was occupied by the unmarried soldiers. On
the left-hand side were a number of rough
whitewood cabins, rudely erected&mdash;such cabins
as are put together for the use of poor emigrants.
The married couples and children
slept in them. Light descended through the
booby-hatch, but the day was very scowling,
as you know, and it needed some use to see
well. A couple of tables were cleated athwartships,
and two or three of the women were preparing
them for dinner. A few soldiers were
sitting about reading or talking. In one of the
berths a baby was crying loudly, and several
children sat in a group in a corner playing.</p>

<p>The good-looking young wife came from
some part of these quarters, or barracks, as I
descended. She showed me a married couple&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
sleeping-berth, and bade me, as I was a young
man, put my head boldly into the single men&#8217;s
cabin and not mind them. I seemed to look,
but in truth I had no eyes but for the strong,
gloomy, prison-like bulkhead which served as
the afterwall of the convicts&#8217; prison. This
bulkhead stretched from side to side. It was
studded with iron knobs, mushroom-shaped.
A number of holes were bored in it&mdash;perhaps
twenty. I knew the object of those holes.
They were intended to receive the muzzles of
muskets, so that a volley of twenty muskets
could be fired at once into the throng of convicts
confined below in case of an uprising or
other tragic trouble. I also observed what
resembled a disk in the centre of this barricade,
somewhat low down. I asked the woman what
it meant. She inquired of a soldier, who answered
that it had been a hole to receive the
muzzle of a cannon, but that the orifice had
been stopped.</p>

<p>&#8216;It&#8217;s handy to command with grape and
canister in case of a difficulty,&#8217; said the soldier,
speaking with an Irish accent. &#8216;A great gun,
loaded to the muzzle, is the right way to keep<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
an oye upon such lads as thim yonder. &#8217;Tis
wan of them oyes that never winks nor
slapes.&#8217;</p>

<p>On the right of the barricade was the door,
where stood the sentry&mdash;the &#8216;Dick&#8217; of my
pretty companion. I had supposed that the
main-hatch was the only means of entering the
&#8217;tweendecks; but this afterdoor, it seems, was
always used by the doctor for going his rounds.</p>

<p>&#8216;Tell him to look and be quick, Jane,&#8217; said
the sentry.</p>

<p>&#8216;Clap your eye to a hole,&#8217; said the young
woman. &#8216;Dick dursn&#8217;t open the door for
you.&#8217;</p>

<p>I did so, and saw almost as much as if the
sentry had opened the door. The light was
faint and dim; such daylight as there was
hung round about the main-hatch where the
stanchions came down from the sides of the
hatch in the form of a gigantic square bird-cage.
There were no scuttles or portholes,
no skylights for the admission of light or air
overhead. The place seemed full of men,
shadowy heaps of them, with a number of
dim shapes in motion, giving a look of wild,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
unnatural vitality to such of the ghostly mob
as sat and were at rest.</p>

<p>The soldier&#8217;s wife put her eye to a loophole
beside mine. I asked her what those
restless figures were about, and she answered
they were messmen and mess helpers preparing
for the convicts&#8217; dinner by half-past
twelve. A double tier of sleeping shelves
divided into compartments, each wide enough
to accommodate several men sleeping side by
side, ran the whole length on either hand of
these &#8217;tweendecks. I heard a subdued growl
of voices and the frequent clank of irons, but
high above all sounded the ceaseless straining
and crazy complaining of the numerous bulkheads
which went to the equipment of the
ship in this part.</p>

<p>Far forward on the left was a sort of
cabin; I knew it was the prison by Will&#8217;s
description. The hospital lay in this end,
and I could not see it. The air was fairly
sweet and fresh where I stood, owing to the
booby-hatch lying wide open, protected as it
was by the cuddy recess; but I seemed to
fancy a dreadful oppression and closeness of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
atmosphere in those &#8217;tweendecks where the
many shadowy shapes were herded. Which
of all those spectral figures was Tom? Oh,
my heart! To think of him in his innocence,
ironed, entombed in that close and dimly-lighted
prison, forced to lie of a night, side by
side with felons, obliged to listen to their
hideous talk, to their boasts of past crimes,
to their threats of darker villainies yet, when
the moment should come to free their hand.</p>

<p>&#8216;Now, Jane, your friend must be off,&#8217;
said the sentry, &#8216;or the doctor&#8217;ll be coming
along.&#8217;</p>

<p>I nodded civilly to him, thanked his
pretty wife, and went on deck. I was half
mad with grief and passion. The reality had
far exceeded my imagination of the wretchedness
and horror of the prisoners&#8217; quarters. I
believe I should have been less shocked had I
passed into the &#8217;tweendecks by way of the
main-hatch; but it was like taking a view of
some nightmare imagination of human misery
to peer through the loophole into that tossing,
straining, and groaning interior, dimly touched
with daylight in the centre, faintly irradiated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
by lantern-light in other parts, the whole
strange shadow of it thickened and jumbled
by the scarcely determinable shapes of men
sitting, standing, moving, the clank of irons
coming from them, and the low growl of
speech.</p>

<p>I went about my work as usual, helped at
the luncheon-table, exchanged sentences with
Frank, cleaned and polished as was now my
business; but all the while I was secretly
raging with sorrow and temper. I was asking
myself: Is it not in my power to release Tom
from this horrible hell? Have I not the wit
to devise a scheme for giving him his liberty?
They may flog me, they may hang me if they
will; let me but enable Tom to get away from
that loathsome jail below, and they may do
what they will. Twenty fancies occurred to
me. I thought of my cousin Will assisting
me to secrete my sweetheart in some part of
the ship, as I had lain hidden, where I should
be able to feed him and where he would lie
until the ship&#8217;s arrival! Then I thought of
his escaping in a quarter-boat which I would
secretly provision for him! But why pursue<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
the catalogue of these ridiculous dreams?
They were a girl&#8217;s passionate, ignorant fancies,
born of despair and wrath. In some of my
fancies I was as wicked as the worst of the
wretches below. I would have sacrificed
every life on board, including my own, to
procure Tom&#8217;s liberty, to free him from the
horrors the unjust hand of the law had heaped
upon him. I would have set fire to the ship,
I would have gnawed a hole in her bottom as
patiently as a rat&#8217;s tooth penetrates a plank,
if by burning, if by sinking, the vessel I
could have liberated my sweetheart.</p>

<p>But I cooled down by degrees. Indeed,
this morning the steward kept me running
about, and I could only think in snatches; so
that meditation was thin and brief, and its
influence light and passing.</p>

<p>During the afternoon, some considerable
time before sunset, the wind shifted, the sky
cleared, and we had fine weather. Sail was
made on the ship. The sea ran in a strong,
dark-blue swell, which shouldered the sunshine
from brow to brow, and filled the ocean in the
south-west with a roving splendour. Two or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
three white sails of ships showed upon the
horizon. I supposed that by this time we
had been blown some distance out of the Bay
of Biscay. Certainly our course had been
straight and our speed thunderous during the
past dark days of storm.</p>

<p>Shortly after the weather cleared the convicts
were ordered on deck. I stood in the
cuddy door to see them assemble. They
came up one by one, and were massed in lines
close to the barricade, with their faces turned
toward the poop. I supposed they had been
disciplined aboard the hulk. The convict
&#8216;captains&#8217; and felon overseers found no difficulty
in marshalling them. The men fell in
as though they had been soldiers, wheeling
about and taking up their positions whilst the
decks rang with short, sharp cries of command
and the tramp of ironed feet. I took a
step on to the quarter-deck and looked up at
the break of the poop, and there saw the doctor,
with Captain Sutherland by his side. The
officers of the guard were at the rail, and behind
stood a number of the guard under arms.</p>

<p>As the barricade obstructed my sight, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
as I was determined to see what was going
on, I picked up a tray and went down the
port gangway alley, as though I had business
at the galley. The yards were braced somewhat
forward, and I stood close to the great
maintack, which sheltered me from the sight
of the poop. Here I could observe without
being seen. Unhappily, my position brought
the backs of the convicts upon me. Tom was
not to be distinguished among that throng of
closely packed felons. A few were in the
hospital; two or three in the prison. There
might be two hundred and twenty men
gathered together behind the barricade&mdash;all
facing aft&mdash;their faces upturned to the doctor.</p>

<p>His purpose in assembling them was to
deliver a lecture. He spoke loudly and with
earnestness, but seemed to have no sense
whatever of irony. It was strange that a
person of his experience should not guess that
the greater part of his discourse would be
listened to with the tongue in the cheek. He
talked to the convicts as though they had
been a congregation of respectable worshippers,
people who led an honest life in their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
trades and houses six days, and on the seventh
attended church, instead of a body of men
of whom two-thirds were hardened scoundrels&mdash;seasoned,
stewed, salted down in crime;
miscreants who would return to their old villainies,
and to viler villainies yet, the instant
they were at large, if the country they found
themselves in provided them with the chances
they wanted.</p>

<p>I remember he told them they were one
large family, and that the opportunities during
the voyage of exercising the best and kindliest
feelings would be ample. Every one was to
prefer his brother to himself. They were not
only to be careful of each other&#8217;s comforts, but
to be kindly watchful over each other&#8217;s speech
and behaviour. &#8216;I forbid,&#8217; said he, &#8216;the use
of all irritating or provoking speech or gestures
in your intercourse with each other, the employment
of all vulgar epithets and unmanly
nicknames, the use of which always indicates
a low and undisciplined mind.&#8217; I listened for
a general laugh when he pointed out the
necessity for convicts cultivating a humble,
meek, and gentle spirit&mdash;submissive, contented,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
and thankful; of their ever remembering
the injury they had inflicted on their
country, and particularly the expense to
which they had put the Government!</p>

<p>The prisoners swayed with the movements
of the deck. They all seemed to listen with
attention to the doctor&#8217;s discourse, but then
any man will appear to listen with attention
to the speech of another who has it in his
power to flog him for not doing so. It was a
strange scene, familiar enough in those days,
never more by any possibility to be beheld
again. On high spread the canvas in cloud
upon cloud, swelling to the western brightness;
soft masses of vapour rolled stately
under a sky of deep, liquid blue; the swaying
mass of convicts in the sickly hue of their
prison dress, their irons like a chain cable
stretching the length of the planks, half filled
the barricade inclosure; at the brass rail
above stood the doctor, flourishing his hand
whilst he addressed them, and the listeners
beside him were thrown out strong upon the
eye by the red line of soldiers standing close
behind. A pause seemed to fall upon the ship;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
the sailors dropped their work to stare and
hearken; the second mate and the apprentices
strained their gaze from the lee side of the
poop at the rows of faces; far aft was the
helmsman, stretching his neck and turning
his head on one side and then on the other,
as though to hear what the doctor said.</p>

<p>&#8216;The youngest amongst you now,&#8217; continued
the doctor, &#8216;in some measure understand
that it is in the strictest sense a moral
discipline which I desire to see in operation on
board this transport. In further proof of
which I shall give orders that those irons&mdash;the
badges of your disgrace&mdash;with which you
are at present fettered, be removed from the
whole of you; and I do most ardently hope
that when I have once caused them to be
struck off, you will not by your conduct
demand of their being again replaced; for
what can be more disgraceful to you and
painful to me than the clanking of those irons
as you walk along the decks?&#8217;</p>

<p>The address lasted about three-quarters of
an hour. Captain Barrett replaced and let
fall his eye-glass with impatience. A number<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
of the convicts were now sent below, to return
presently, as I supposed, when the others
should have taken their allowance of exercise.
I dared not linger, and walked slowly aft,
sending searching looks at the prisoners,
though I did not see Tom. How was I to
deliver my letter? But it chanced that I had
sight of many strange faces. A gang of
prisoners passed close as I went toward the
cuddy; a few were grey-haired men, bowed
and wrinkled; some were young, and I
marked that all these had defiant looks. One
countenance, quickly as it passed, impressed
me strongly; the man had fine, large, black,
flashing eyes, and was a handsome, dark person,
half a head taller than those who trudged near
him; he held himself erect, and I seemed to
notice a sort of theatrical air in his strides
spite of the irons. I had heard someone say
there was an actor among the felons, and I
guessed that man was he.</p>

<small>SHE ALARMS HER COUSIN</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> the dinner-table that day most of the talk
I caught concerned the convicts and the
Australian settlements. Captain Barrett told
the doctor that he considered his address to
the prisoners deuced fine. The doctor bowed.</p>

<p>&#8216;What makes criminals, sir?&#8217; asked Captain
Sutherland.</p>

<p>&#8216;The dislike of honest labour,&#8217; answered
the doctor.</p>

<p>&#8216;It&#8217;s the mothers who make the criminals,&#8217;
said the lieutenant.</p>

<p>The doctor viewed him sternly. I do
not think he loved these discussions.</p>

<p>&#8216;Don&#8217;t the magnetic character of an iron
ship depend upon the direction of her head
while building?&#8217; said the lieutenant.</p>

<p>&#8216;I have seen but one iron ship, sir,&#8217; said
Captain Sutherland.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>&#8216;Well,&#8217; continued the lieutenant, &#8216;it&#8217;s so
with the baby before birth: the mother may
choose her own compass bearings for the child&mdash;virtue
or vice, as may be. &#8217;Tis the mother
has the building of the bairn, look you, Ellice.
If she don&#8217;t go right whilst the bairn&#8217;s putting
together, be sorry for the little &#8217;un. He&#8217;s
booked in irons and a gray suit for a shiny
land.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Fudge,&#8217; said the doctor.</p>

<p>The captain, however, seemed impressed
by the lieutenant&#8217;s opinion, and continued to
look at him.</p>

<p>&#8216;Did you ever have charge of an uglier lot,
Ellice?&#8217; asked Captain Barrett.</p>

<p>&#8216;I don&#8217;t recognise human ugliness,&#8217;
answered the doctor. &#8216;Is the egg bad?
That&#8217;s it; never mind the look and colour
of the shell.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What becomes of a convict when he dies?&#8217;
said the lieutenant.</p>

<p>&#8216;What becomes of the ripple when it
breaks upon the shore?&#8217; answered Captain
Sutherland.</p>

<p>&#8216;Do convicts really stand any chance out<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
in the colonies, do you think?&#8217; said the lieutenant.</p>

<p>&#8216;An excellent chance,&#8217; said the doctor.</p>

<p>&#8216;Too good a chance!&#8217; exclaimed Captain
Sutherland.</p>

<p>I pricked my ears. I was then at the end
of the cuddy waiting till the gentlemen should
have done with certain dishes which it would
be my business to carry forward.</p>

<p>&#8216;How is a rogue to establish himself?&#8217;
asked Lieutenant Chimmo.</p>

<p>&#8216;There&#8217;s plenty to be done,&#8217; answered the
doctor. &#8216;Labour is always in demand. When
a man is on ticket-of-leave he may live where
he pleases.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;They are much better used than our
labourers at home,&#8217; said Captain Sutherland.</p>

<p>&#8216;What about the chain-gangs?&#8217; exclaimed
Captain Barrett.</p>

<p>&#8216;The chain-gang is punishment,&#8217; said the
doctor. &#8216;It is hard work, but not harder than
the toil of many an honest man at home for a
famishing wage. Not harder than the labours
of a French fishwife, for example.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I would rather work in a chain-gang<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
than dig in a coal mine,&#8217; said Captain Sutherland.</p>

<p>&#8216;A convict&#8217;s hired out as a servant by the
Government to the applicant, isn&#8217;t he?&#8217; said
Captain Barrett.</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes. You must be a landholder if you
apply. I&#8217;m speaking of New South Wales,&#8217;
answered the doctor. &#8216;You must hold three
hundred and twenty acres for every one convict
you get. Seventy-five convicts are the
limit. No man may have more.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Should you feel happy, Barrett,&#8217; said
Lieutenant Chimmo, &#8216;to be waited on and
generally done for by seventy-five of the
gentry in our &#8217;tweendecks? How would you
like to be shaved by a cracksman, tucked up
every night by an incendiary, cooked for by
a chemist lagged for a trifling blunder in the
shape of strychnia, waited on behind your
chair, you know, by a gent who has been
spun for digging up bodies?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Are the convicts decently well fed out in
the settlements?&#8217; inquired Captain Barrett.</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes. The hirer&#8217;s obliged to give his
man plenty to eat. He&#8217;s made to sign a bond,&#8217;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
responded the doctor. &#8216;The convicts feed on
beef, mutton, and pork, and they get wheat
and maize meal; their clothes are two jackets
and two pairs of trousers a year, shoes and
shirts, and a mattress and blankets besides.&#8217;</p>

<p>Just then the steward motioned to me,
and I was sent out of the cuddy.</p>

<p>This talk made me very thoughtful. I
went about my work as full of reflection as
though I had been planning a poem. What
was the cost of land by the acre in Tasmania?
If I purchased three hundred and twenty
acres in that country, would they give me
Tom for a servant? Or, suppose Tom should
be hired before I qualified for a landholder,
for I was without a friend in Tasmania and
months must pass before I could receive
money from England, should I be able to
bribe his employer into parting with him?
My spirits mounted with my fancies. The
doctor knew what he was talking about, and
in imagination I beheld myself the owner of
a little estate in Tasmania with Tom by my
side, and our home as happy as love could
make it.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>In the first dog-watch that evening I had
an hour to myself. The wind was mild and
sweet, and the sea ran in soft folds. Frank
had told me that the ship was many miles to
the south of the Bay of Biscay, and that if our
course was to be shaped east we should bring
Gibraltar over the bow.</p>

<p>This young German joined me whilst I
stood near the cuddy door, and asked me to
smoke a pipe. I said that my pipes had been
broken for me by the boatswain. He offered
to lend me a pipe. I told him that the ship&#8217;s
tobacco was too strong for my taste, that I
was never much of a smoker, and then changed
the subject, but watched him whilst he talked;
conscience made me afraid; then again, I was
much thrown with this young man who,
though an insipid German, was not wholly a
fool: it was impossible to say what little hints
or tricks of my sex he might have observed.</p>

<p>I was made uneasier still later on, when
Lieutenant Chimmo stepped through the
cuddy door with a cigar in his mouth; he
was passing, then paused and stood puffing
and looking at me without taking the least<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
notice of the German steward. I was nearly
as tall as this subaltern.</p>

<p>&#8216;Are you an only child?&#8217; said he.</p>

<p>I stared at him, and in that instant meant
not to answer; changed my mind, and
answered: &#8216;Yes, sir.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;A pity!&#8217; said he. &#8216;If you had a sister
and she resembled you, she would be&mdash;&mdash;&#8217; He
glanced at Frank, who was grinning, checked
his speech with a face of contempt, and
addressing me again, exclaimed: &#8216;I hear they
are gradually making discoveries about you!&#8217;</p>

<p>This startled me, and I may have looked
at him earnestly.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh,&#8217; said he, smiling, &#8216;nothing&#8217;s been
found out that&#8217;s going to bring you into
trouble; on the contrary, you prove much
more respectable than you seemed to wish us
to believe, when you were dug up out of that
hole forward. Your father was a sea-captain&mdash;the
sea is a very honest calling. But why
should you run away from your home to
become a cuddy under-steward? There&#8217;s no
ambition in that, my lad, is there?&#8217; He cast
another look of contempt at Frank. &#8216;Unless,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
indeed, you were for carrying out the old-established
notions of the story-writers who
are always sending their runaway heroes to
sea as cabin-boys.&#8217;</p>

<p>At this moment, Captain Barrett, who was
on the poop, overhearing the subaltern&#8217;s
voice, called to him, and Lieutenant Chimmo
went up the ladder.</p>

<p>&#8216;I should like to be talked about as you
are,&#8217; said Frank. &#8216;Dot means dey know you
vhas a shentleman. You vill find dot dey do
not talk about me. I fonder dot they doan
give you some verk your little handts vhas
more fit for dan vashing plates.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I wish they would not talk about me,&#8217;
said I. &#8216;I am comfortable and content. I
wish to travel to Tasmania in my own way.
I earn my food. I shan&#8217;t receive a shilling
for my services. Why will they talk?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Dere vhas something about you, Marlowe,&#8217;
said Frank, &#8216;dot oxcites and puzzles
them. She oxcites and puzzles me too. What
vhas it? Potsblitz! I likes to talk about
you myself if I meets mit any one dot vill
talk about you likewise.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>He was proceeding in this strain when my
cousin Will came along the gangway alley.
All the convicts were below at supper.
Nobody was on the main-deck but the sentry
at the hatch. A number of seamen were
assembled on the forecastle, and amongst
them were a few of the guard. At the break
of that raised fore-deck stalked the sentinel,
and his bayonet gleamed in the sun as though
wet with blood.</p>

<p>&#8216;Marlowe,&#8217; said my cousin, halting at a
distance, &#8216;come forward and I&#8217;ll give you the
things I promised you.&#8217;</p>

<p>And having said this he walked away as
though he had condescended enough. And
he was wise to treat me so, for on stepping
out of the recess and turning my head I saw
the captain and the doctor and the two
officers of the guard standing at the rail in
conversation.</p>

<p>I followed my cousin to his cabin. He
had entered before me, and when I arrived I
found him alone.</p>

<p>&#8216;I shan&#8217;t call you Marian any more,&#8217; said
he. &#8216;Suppose I should be overheard? And<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
I&#8217;ll not call you Simon either. Why didn&#8217;t
you ship as Jack or Bill? Take now what
you want, and when you have shifted give me
your soiled clothes and I&#8217;ll get them washed.&#8217;</p>

<p>He raised the lid of his chest, and I took
a flannel shirt and such other apparel as I
needed.</p>

<p>&#8216;You&#8217;ll find that pilot coat melting wear a
few degrees further south,&#8217; said he. &#8216;Here&#8217;s
a serge jacket. Will it fit you?&#8217;</p>

<p>I put it on, then rolled the clothes into a
bundle and stayed to talk.</p>

<p>&#8216;Will, does anyone on board suspect I&#8217;m a
woman?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I don&#8217;t know of any one,&#8217; he answered;
&#8216;what&#8217;s put that into your head?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Nothing. I don&#8217;t want to be found out.
Depend upon it, if the doctor and the others
discovered that I was a girl, they&#8217;d suspect
me of some desperate purpose and send me
out of the ship at the first chance.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;That&#8217;s likely,&#8217; said Will, cutting up a
piece of tobacco to fill his pipe with; &#8216;but
who&#8217;d imagine you&#8217;re a girl? You walk like
a man and begin to roll about like a sailor.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
You lug your basket of foul dishes forward in
true bottle-washer fashion.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Not so loud,&#8217; said I, looking toward the
door.</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8217;ve heard nothing about you for&#8217;ard,&#8217; he
continued. &#8216;They occasionally talk of you
aft. I catch scraps of speech as the skipper
and the others stump the poop. I heard that
fellow, Captain Barrett, say that he notices
you take a great interest in all talk at table
that concerns the convicts. I&#8217;d wear a deaf
face in the cuddy, if I were you.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8217;ll do so. That Captain Barrett&#8217;s right.
The hint won&#8217;t be lost, I assure you,&#8217; said I,
looking at myself in a square of glass and
observing by the strong red light that my
complexion had been something darkened
already by my frequent exposure on deck,
though it was still too soft and delicate a skin
to please me. &#8216;But,&#8217; said I, speaking low, &#8216;I
shan&#8217;t greatly heed any suspicions that don&#8217;t
touch my sex.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Have you seen anything more of Butler?&#8217;
he asked, also speaking low.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>I shook my head with a sigh, and, pulling
the letter from my pocket, told him how long
it had been written, and that I had found no
chance of delivering it.</p>

<p>&#8216;Now mind how you attempt to deliver
it!&#8217; he exclaimed. &#8216;If the sentry sees you
giving it to him, say good-night to your
projects, for they&#8217;ll find out you&#8217;re a woman,
and lock you up for examination and punishment
on your arrival. They&#8217;re hideously in
earnest in these ships. And take care that
you don&#8217;t get Tom flogged.&#8217;</p>

<p>This talk frightened and angered me too.
I took several turns up and down the little
berth, whilst he smoked and watched me, and
then said: &#8216;I must risk it. Tom shall get
this letter, and then I&#8217;ll be satisfied.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;If the third mate could be trusted,&#8217; said
he, &#8216;it might be contrived without risk. He
serves out stores to the convicts, and Butler&#8217;s
one of the gang who fetches the stuff. I
heard the third mate tell Mr. Bates that.
Bates takes a good deal of interest in Butler.
It was only yesterday he was talking to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
captain, and I heard him say he considered
Butler an injured man.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;&#8220;Injured!&#8221;&#8217; I cried, scornful of that meek
word.</p>

<p>&#8216;But the third mate mustn&#8217;t be trusted, so
there&#8217;s an end.&#8217;</p>

<p>I looked at Will steadily, and said in a soft
voice: &#8216;Isn&#8217;t Tom to be freed?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;&#8220;Freed?&#8221;&#8217; he echoed.</p>

<p>&#8216;Got out of the ship?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;How?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;You&#8217;re the sailor. Will. How would you
go to work to enable an innocent man to
escape from a convict ship?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;How would I go to work?&#8217; He paused
with his mouth open and the hand which held
his pipe arrested midway. &#8216;How would I go
to work? I&#8217;d tell him to jump overboard, or
I&#8217;d slip a knife into his hand that he might
cut his throat. What other way? Escape!
Escape from a convict ship on the high seas!
With loaded muskets ready to make eyelets
in a man&#8217;s head at any moment in the night
or day, with look-outs for&#8217;ard and look-outs
aft, and a sentry below with a bayonet fixed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
for the first. Now, see here,&#8217; said he, growing
pale and putting his pipe down, &#8216;if you talk
like that, if you allow any fancy of helping
Tom to escape to enter your head, then, to
save you from God alone knows what consequences,
I&#8217;ll go right aft to the skipper and
make a clean breast of it.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I don&#8217;t say that it is to be done,&#8217; said I,
vexed that I should have so agitated him, &#8216;but
is there any harm in talking, Will?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes, in talking of such things as that.
You are madly in love with Butler, and your
notions and your dreams of helping him are
mad. Haven&#8217;t you made sacrifice enough for
the man? Do you want to become a felon
too? That won&#8217;t help him.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What could I do that you should talk to
me like this?&#8217; said I, reddening and staring at
him in my old fiery way.</p>

<p>&#8216;You could do nothing,&#8217; he answered,
&#8216;and that&#8217;s just it. But you can talk and you
might attempt, and I&#8217;ll blow the gaff, so help
me God, if you don&#8217;t give me your word.&#8217;</p>

<p>He was as red as I, and his face worked
with consternation and anger.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>&#8216;I give you my word,&#8217; I exclaimed, and
took him in my arms and kissed him on either
cheek.</p>

<p>The boy was deeply moved and almost
crying. Just then an apprentice came into
the berth, on which, in a changed voice, I
thanked Will for his kindness, picked up my
bundle, and walked aft.</p>

<p>My talk had so deeply scared my cousin
that he took an opportunity before that
evening was gone of again speaking to me.
He implored me not to believe for an instant
that Tom could escape out of this ship at sea.
&#8216;You can&#8217;t help him,&#8217; said he. &#8216;But what
might happen to you? The punishment for
helping a convict to escape is fearfully heavy.
They&#8217;d try you at some Tasmanian court of
justice and make a felon of you. You&#8217;d be a
female convict, associating with the vilest of
the vile of your own sex. Why, sooner than
such a thing should happen, I&#8217;d go straight to
the skipper and tell him who you are!&#8217;</p>

<p>I answered with a hot face and angry eyes
that if I could help Tom to escape, they might
do what they liked afterwards&mdash;mangle me,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
crucify me, bury me alive. &#8216;But what is the
good of talking?&#8217; I said. &#8216;I know there is
nothing to be done. Don&#8217;t tell me I love Tom
as if I were a mad woman. It maddens me
to hear that said. I love him as sanely as
your father loves your mother. I love him
loyally and with all my heart. We were to
have been married, and, before God, we are
married, and who shall hinder me from fulfilling
my unspoken marriage vow to abandon
everybody and cleave only to my love?&#8217; Here
a great sob interrupted me, but I fought with
my tears and after a little struggling pause I
continued: &#8216;I will do nothing rash, Will. Be
easy, dear heart. I would help Tom to escape
this night if I could, but I cannot; I
can do nothing: so rest your peace of mind
on that.&#8217;</p>

<small>SHE DELIVERS HER LETTER, AND SEES A CONVICT
PUNISHED</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Next</span> morning on coming into the cuddy from
my berth and looking through the door, I
saw a number of convicts washing the decks
down. Some were on the forecastle, some in
the barricaded inclosure, and three or four
were scrubbing the quarter-deck close beside
the cuddy front. Every morning small gangs
of the felons helped the sailors to wash down,
whilst numbers below scrubbed their own
quarters out. The boatswain and his mates
and the captains of the gangs superintended,
hurled the water along the decks out of the
buckets handed to them, and kept the men to
their work. It was a very fine morning; the
wind was on the quarter, and the second mate
overhead was calling to some hands aloft
who were rigging out booms for the setting of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
those wide overhanging wings of canvas called
&#8216;studding-sails.&#8217;</p>

<p>I immediately observed that the convicts
were without irons. What with the soldiers,
the prisoners, the sailors scrubbing or preparing
to run the studding-sails aloft; what
with the flashing of the sun on the wet decks,
the pendulum swing of the straight-lined
shadows of the rigging, the blowing of smoke
from the two galley chimneys, combined with
the sense of life in the noises of people scrubbing
the poop overhead, of the bleating of
sheep forward, the crowing of cocks, the
grunting of a sow, the clanking of the head
and poop pumps, the ceaseless gushing of
water&mdash;the scene was one of such life and
motion as forbade me for a little while from
distinguishing.</p>

<p>I looked eagerly for Tom. The steward
called to me sharply and angrily, after which
I was for half an hour occupied with Frank in
cleaning down the cuddy, without a single
opportunity to turn my eyes toward the main
deck. When this odious task was ended, Mr.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
Stiles gave me a piece of raw bacon to carry
to the cook for the cuddy breakfast.</p>

<p>I took care to hold the letter in the palm
of my hand, in the hope that I should meet
Tom as I went or returned. A batch of about
fifty convicts, stripped to the waist, were
washing themselves on the port side of the
main-deck, close against the barricade of the
gangway alley. The doctor stood, viewing
them, at a little distance. Two or three
&#8216;captains&#8217; walked to and fro, to observe that
the men washed themselves properly. Seeing
no other convicts on deck, I went along the
gangway alley, and with my head straight,
but with my eyes in the corner that the doctor
might not detect my scrutiny, I narrowly
viewed the convicts as I stepped forward, but
Tom was not of that gang.</p>

<p>On coming, however, abreast of the
prisoners&#8217; galley, I saw my sweetheart inside.
I did not notice what he was about. No
doubt he had been told off to help the cooks
that morning, or maybe he was there on some
errand relating to his mess. Be this as it may,
I saw him in an instant, and formed my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span>
resolution in a single beat of my heart. I
coughed. The note of my cough made him
turn his head. Even whilst our eyes met I
entered the galley in which he stood.</p>

<p>&#8216;Here, cook,&#8217; said I, &#8216;the steward
says&mdash;&mdash;&#8217; I started as though I had discovered
my error. &#8216;I beg pardon for mistaking
the galley,&#8217; said I, and in turning, as
though to leave, I purposely struck my foot
against the coaming of the door, fell a step
backward, and let fall the dish and the bacon.
The dish was of tin: had it been crockery I
should have let it fall all the same, though
the noise of the breakage might have brought
the doctor to the door. Tom stooped to pick
up the bacon; our fingers touched, and I
slipped the letter into his hand.</p>

<p>This was admirably done; the swiftness of
the man&#339;uvre renders it one of the most
memorable of my exploits in this way. I had
feared that Tom would not understand in time
to render the trick successful, but the moment
he felt the letter his hand closed upon it. I
did not look at him or attempt to breathe a
syllable, though our faces were close when we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
stooped. I could not tell who besides Tom
was in that galley: there were several persons,
convicts no doubt, men whose behaviour in
the hulks had warranted the doctor in giving
them posts of some little consequence and
trust. All had happened so quickly, that I
could not say whether the others besides Tom
were clothed as felons or not.</p>

<p>This convicts&#8217; galley, I should explain,
was a temporary deck structure, built
strongly abaft the ship&#8217;s galley, furnished
with an abundant cooking apparatus, as you
may suppose would be needed for the feeding
of two hundred and thirty souls. None of
the crew were suffered to enter it; it was
sentinelled by convict warders or captains
only. It was inspected every day by the
doctor, and closed and locked when the
convicts&#8217; supper had been handed along.</p>

<p>I came out of the ship&#8217;s galley with a rejoicing
heart, and peeped at the door of the
other as I passed, but Tom was not in sight.
However, he now had my letter; no risk had
been run, not the most suspicious mind, not
the most vigilant eye in the ship, could have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
imagined or detected what had passed
between my sweetheart and me. My spirits
were in a dance; for my letter would tell
him as much&mdash;as much to the point, I mean&mdash;as
my lips could have uttered in a half-hour&#8217;s
meeting. I figured his impatience to
read it, the glow of hope and pleasure that
would warm his poor, dear heart as he read,
the courage and support he would get out
of it.</p>

<p>&#8216;You vhas light-hearted this morning,&#8217;
said Frank to me, as we helped the steward
to prepare the breakfast-table. &#8216;Dere vhas
no twopenny postman at sea, or I should
say dot you hov&#8217; received some goodt news.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;It is the weather,&#8217; I answered; &#8216;and then
a young apprentice has kindly given me a
clean flannel shirt to wear.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Who&#8217;s the apprentice?&#8217; exclaimed Mr.
Stiles, who overheard me.</p>

<p>&#8216;Mr. Johnstone,&#8217; I answered.</p>

<p>&#8216;Picked him up aboard, or did yer know
him before you stowed yourself away?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;My father was a client of his father&#8217;s,&#8217; I
replied.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>&#8216;Wither me if it ain&#8217;t a-coming stronger
and stronger with you every day!&#8217; exclaimed
Mr. Stiles. &#8216;What are you going to turn out
afore you&#8217;re done?&#8217; he added, stopping in his
work to look at me.</p>

<p>&#8216;I tell you vhat it vhas, sir,&#8217; said Frank.
&#8216;Dis vhas no ordinary shentleman. Dis vhas
a young nobleman in disguise.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Hold your yaw-yawing!&#8217; cried the
steward. &#8216;Who&#8217;s a-talking to you? You&#8217;re
always a-putting in, you are, and a-stopping
the work.&#8217;</p>

<p>The cuddy breakfast-bell was rung, and
at half-past eight the captain and officers
seated themselves. I received a sort of nod
from Lieutenant Chimmo, and Captain Barrett
looked at me pleasantly. Both men suggested
that they regarded me as coming near to
their social level. This was odd, for, as a rule,
people rather shrink from and give the cold
shoulder to gentle-folks who have been sunk
by fortune into getting their bread in mean
positions such as mine was on board that ship.
Captain Sutherland never heeded me, but
sometimes I thought the doctor&#8217;s stern eyes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
rested upon me with an expression of inquiry.
The cuddy was full of sunlight; the glory of
the morning sparkled in glass and crystal and
plate, and the radiance was made lovely by
the soft atmospheric azure tint which floated
into it off the blue sea.</p>

<p>&#8216;When do you start your school, doctor?&#8217;
said Captain Barrett.</p>

<p>&#8216;On Monday,&#8217; was the answer.</p>

<p>&#8216;Captain,&#8217; said Lieutenant Chimmo, addressing
the commander of the ship, &#8216;did you
see Barney Abram washing himself this morning?
What a chest! What arms! Cut his
head and legs off, fossilise what&#8217;s left, chuck
the torso into the Tiber, and when dredged
up it would be sworn to as the most magnificent
fragment of ancient art in the wide
world.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;A pity, Ellice,&#8217; said Captain Barrett,
&#8216;that you object to Barney stepping aft
occasionally to give Chimmo and me a few
tips in the grandest of all sciences.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;The most degrading, sir,&#8217; said the doctor.
&#8216;I am surprised that you should think proper
to repeat the request.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>&#8216;The voyage is a doocid long one,&#8217;
murmured Captain Barrett.</p>

<p>&#8216;Isn&#8217;t there to be some punishment this
morning?&#8217; asked Captain Sutherland.</p>

<p>&#8216;A little light punishment,&#8217; answered the
doctor&mdash;&#8216;two hours of the box.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;You don&#8217;t believe in the cat, sir?&#8217; said
Captain Barrett.</p>

<p>&#8216;I do not,&#8217; answered the doctor.</p>

<p>&#8216;I believed in the cat until pickling went
out of fashion,&#8217; said the subaltern. &#8216;A man
who had been salted down whilst bleeding
seldom courted a second dose; but now I
understand your man-of-war&#8217;s man thinks so
lightly of flogging that he would rather take
three dozen than forfeit a day&#8217;s allowance of
grog.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8217;m no lover of the cat myself,&#8217; said
Captain Sutherland, &#8216;but it&#8217;s good discipline.
It&#8217;s a degrading punishment, very proper for
degraded men. I have some men forward
who deserve whipping, and whipping, perhaps,
isn&#8217;t enough for them; nor would
pickling suffice. They want quartering. The
Government forces us commanders of hired<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
transports to fill our forecastle with a given
number of hands. No questions are asked.
So long as your complement numerically
corresponds with the Government requirement,
all&#8217;s supposed to be right. Now, what
sort of a crew did the crimp scramble together
for me that my muster might answer to the
Admiralty wants? I&#8217;ve about six seamen
qualified to steer. I doubt if there are ten
men forward who know how to send down a
yard. But one has to take what one can get.
The crimp comes along and throws a gutter-brood
aboard; some are not fit even as
shilling-a-monthers, and have bribed the
crimp to the pawning of their only shirt to
ship them, that they may get abroad, where
they&#8217;ll run.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I don&#8217;t like the looks of a good many of
your men,&#8217; said the doctor.</p>

<p>&#8216;But you could muster strongly enough
for an emergency, captain?&#8217; said the subaltern.</p>

<p>&#8216;What do you mean by an emergency?&#8217;
said Captain Sutherland.</p>

<p>&#8216;A heavy squall of wind, sir, and the ship
aback with royals set.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>&#8216;Where the deuce did you pick up your
nautical knowledge, Chimmo?&#8217; said Captain
Barrett.</p>

<p>&#8216;Is that an emergency, captain?&#8217; asked
the subaltern.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, I&#8217;ve no doubt we could manage, I&#8217;ve
no doubt we could manage,&#8217; answered the
captain, with something of gloomy impatience.</p>

<p>Here I was dispatched to the pantry, and
when I returned after a considerable interval
the gentlemen had gone on deck.</p>

<p>As Tom was always in my mind when any
sort of reference was made to the convicts, I
was very eager and anxious to know what the
punishment of the box was&mdash;to speak of it as
the doctor had&mdash;and who was the culprit.
A number of prisoners were assembled between
the barricades, whether employed or
not I do not recollect. The steward had
gone forward, in all probability to smoke a
pipe with the cook, under pretence of talking
about the cabin dinner. I stood in the cuddy
doorway viewing the prisoners, yearning for
a sight of Tom, that by a swift look or smile
he might let me know he had read my letter.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
An apprentice struck four bells&mdash;ten o&#8217;clock.
The doctor came up from the prisoners&#8217;
quarters followed by Captain Barrett and the
sergeant of the guard, and the three of them
stood under the break of the poop, near
enough for me to overhear them, though they
could not see me.</p>

<p>Scarcely had the bell struck when a
convict in irons passed out of the main-hatch.
Two convict warders were with him and each,
grasping an arm, marched him to that sort of
sentry box which I have before described&mdash;a
contrivance of about the width of a coffin
and a trifle longer or higher, with a bucket
hanging from a bar over it. The convict
struggled angrily, and I guessed by the faces
of those who were near enough for me to
read that he cursed and swore very vilely,
but only now and then did I catch an oath.
A man stepped forward and threw open the
front of the coffin-like structure, then helped
the others to twist the prisoner with his face
looking inboards, and when they had put him
into this posture they thrust him backwards
into the box and shut him up.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>He was a young fellow of about twenty-two,
with the wickedest face of any man&#8217;s in
the ship. A grinning, wrinkled seaman stood
beside the box holding the rope that was
attached to the bucket. Another seaman
was near, and beside him were four or five
buckets of water.</p>

<p>&#8216;He&#8217;s a profane rascal, and I have no
hopes of him,&#8217; I heard the doctor say.</p>

<p>&#8216;Why not flog him?&#8217; said Captain Barrett.</p>

<p>&#8216;It may come to it, but I trust not.&#8217;</p>

<p>Meanwhile the prisoner in the box was
bawling at the top of his voice and doubtless
using horrid language. I observed that the
wrinkled, grinning seaman watched the doctor,
who, after a few minutes&#8217; pause, lifted his
hand as a signal, whereupon the sailor pulled
the rope and tilted the bucket, and the water
fell in a heavy splash upon the blaspheming
youth boxed up inside.</p>

<p>Captain Barrett gave a great laugh. Indeed,
a noise of laughter ran through the
ship. A number of sailors, who had gathered
together in sundry parts to witness the
spectacle, seemed to find much to be pleased<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
with in it. The prisoners within the inclosure
grinned, without sound of merriment, and I
thought that the rascally faces amongst them
looked the rascallier for their smiles. The
second sailor beside the box filled the hanging
bucket afresh, and the wrinkled mariner
continued to watch the doctor.</p>

<p>&#8216;That&#8217;ll have extinguished the brimstone
in him!&#8217; exclaimed Captain Barrett, giving
another great laugh. &#8216;Is the idea yours?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;No,&#8217; answered the doctor. &#8216;I took the
idea from a female convict ship which I went
on board of at Sydney.&#8217;</p>

<p>By this time the half-drowned youth
within had recovered his breath and was
roaring out curses again. The doctor waited
three minutes; then signed. The wrinkled
sailor tilted the bucket, and the coffined
wretch was soused for the second time. Once
more Captain Barrett laughed loudly, and a
rumble of laughter came from the seamen,
who hung about in groups forward. I had
imagined that two buckets would have done
the fellow&#8217;s business for him, yet in five
minutes he began to curse and swear once<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
more, whereupon a third bucket was upset
over his head. This proved effectual. No
more noise proceeded from the inside of the
box. The doctor, having waited some time,
spoke to Captain Barrett, who crossed to the
sentry at the quarter-deck barricade-gate and
delivered certain instructions. Shortly afterward,
Mr. Stiles came into the cuddy and
ordered me to the pantry. I afterwards
heard that the fellow in the box was silent
whilst he stood in it, and that when he was
let out and taken below he looked the most
miserable, soaked, scowling, shame-faced,
shivering wretch that was ever clothed in
felon&#8217;s garb.</p>

<small>SHE ATTENDS CHURCH SERVICE AND WITNESSES
A TRAGEDY</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> lunch that day the doctor congratulated
himself warmly upon the success of the
ducking punishment. &#8216;I never doubted,&#8217; said
he, &#8216;that it would fail in the case of female
convicts. Two buckets they told me sufficed
for the most clamorous of the foul-mouths.
But I had my misgivings as to its efficacy
with male prisoners. I am satisfied. The
fellow below seems to have been soaked into
repentance. I spoke to him in the prison a
little while since, and he humbly begged my
pardon and promised never to use another
oath again.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;It&#8217;s a goosefleshing discipline,&#8217; said Captain
Barrett! &#8216;but they&#8217;ll make a joke of it
in the tropics.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>&#8216;Is this box arrangement your only
punishment, Ellice?&#8217; said the subaltern.</p>

<p>&#8216;We have thin water-gruel,&#8217; answered the
doctor. &#8216;I know a man who became sincerely
religious after two days of thin water-gruel.
Then there are the irons which I have struck
off, with or without the addition of handcuffs.
Then there is the prison. Separation works
wholesomely. Loneliness is good physic for
the felon mind. Finally, there&#8217;s a black-list,
in which I enter the offender&#8217;s name for submission
to his Excellency the Governor at the
end of the voyage.&#8217;</p>

<p>The subject was then changed. To this
brief talk I listened greedily, forgetting Will&#8217;s
hint that I should carry a deaf face. I met
the doctor&#8217;s eyes, but my duties dismissed me
to the galley, and I was out of the cuddy
while the meal lasted.</p>

<p>That afternoon, whilst I was rubbing the
shining length of cuddy-table, the doctor
came from his cabin. He looked at me a
moment or two and then approached. There
was a sort of kindness in his manner; he even
put on a grave, condescending smile when he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
addressed me. It was seldom that Doctor
Russell-Ellice smiled.</p>

<p>&#8216;I am glad to believe,&#8217; said he, &#8216;that I was
mistaken in you. One of the apprentices,
who, I understand, is very respectably connected,
has, I hear, some knowledge of you.
But, young man, you should have chosen any
vessel sooner than a convict ship to hide
yourself in.&#8217;</p>

<p>I cast my eyes down.</p>

<p>&#8216;I observe that you take a great interest
in all conversation that relates to convicts. I
am willing to believe you honest. You will
therefore give me, truthfully, your reason for
the interest you take in the prisoners?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;It is curiosity more than interest, sir.
I have often read and heard about convict
ships. I cannot help feeling curious and
listening and looking about me.&#8217;</p>

<p>He stared at me searchingly and seemed
satisfied. But I noticed with some alarm that
he observed my face with unusual attention,
taking the lineaments, so to speak, one by
one. He then glanced down me&mdash;afterwards
let his eyes rest upon my hands, and all this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
in silence which might have filled an interval
of nearly a minute.</p>

<p>&#8216;What&#8217;s your age?&#8217; he asked.</p>

<p>This was forcing my hand; but then I
was a woman, and no woman is expected to
tell the truth when she is asked her age.</p>

<p>&#8216;I am seventeen, sir.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;You do not seem to have been ill-used,&#8217;
said he, again gravely smiling. &#8216;A plumper,
healthier young fellow I never met. What
made you run away?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I wished to go to Hobart Town.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Would not your friends have equipped
and sent you out respectably had you made
known your wishes?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;My stepfather is no friend of mine, sir,&#8217; I
answered.</p>

<p>He asked me what I meant to do when I
arrived in Tasmania, and after putting many
questions, most of which I answered, he bade
me tell him what my religion was, in what
churches I worshipped, and then began to
lecture me; indeed, to sermonise me as though
I had been a convict under him. I listened
with a hung head and composed face, but I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
could not draw my breath freely till he was
gone, for all the time he addressed me his
dark, scrutinising eyes seemed to search into
my very conscience. And then again I feared
his perception as a medical man.</p>

<p>Next day was Sunday. The captain sent
word forward, and the instructions reached
us aft, that the whole of the ship&#8217;s company
were to attend Divine service on the poop at
ten o&#8217;clock. It was again a bright and beautiful
day. When I went on deck in the early
morning, I was in time to behold a most
glorious pink and silver sunrise; our coppered
forefoot had cloven the first of the warm
parallels, and already the flying-fish were
darting from the froth of the curl of the low
wave; the ship was heaped with gleaming
spaces of canvas to her trucks, and was
leaning over to the pressure of the cordial
breath of the north-east trade-wind. She was
sailing fast; the sea was smooth, and the
spitting of the narrow band of passing brine
was like the sound of satin torn by the hand;
and satin-like was the long gleam of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
water, with a few small seabirds swiftly
winging along it in chase.</p>

<p>The routine, I observed, was the same as
on other days. The convict deck-washers,
superintended by the captains of deck, helped
the watch to wash down as usual; the cooks
were admitted past the sentry, and speedily a
cloud of black smoke was blowing from the
prisoners&#8217; galley chimney. When the decks
had been swabbed, the convicts in divisions
were turned up to wash themselves, and at
eight o&#8217;clock they went to breakfast.</p>

<p>It was whilst the messmen were standing
in a compact row beyond the main-hatch
door waiting for their cans of cocoa, that I
saw Tom. He was one of the messmen. I
found an excuse to pass him thrice, that I
might greet him with my eyes and observe
him. I saw passion and grief and love in his
face when our gaze met, though neither of
us durst venture on more than a passing look.
It half broke my heart that I should be so
close to him and yet unable to speak. Whilst
he waited with the rest I could, indeed, have
made shift to pass him a fourth time, but the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
strain was so terrible that I feared myself. I
felt a swelling within me as of hysteria, an
ungovernable madness to rush to him, to
fling my arms about his neck, to hold him to
me. So I passed into the cuddy, and a
little later the body of prisoners went below
and, saving the sentries, the inclosure was
empty.</p>

<p>After the cuddy breakfast was over, whilst
taking some dirty dishes forward, I met
Will near the galley. He said, softly: &#8216;I was
on the poop watching you when you walked
up and down past Butler to look at him.
Old woman, these are risks and you mustn&#8217;t
run &#8217;m. There are eyes aboard here sharper
than that chap&#8217;s bayonet.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8217;ll run no risks, and all&#8217;s well so far,
Will.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What about that letter you were telling
me of? I dread to hear of your attempting
to give it to your sweetheart.&#8217;</p>

<p>I looked at him with a smile. He asked
me if I slept comfortably, if his clothes fitted
me, if I had seen the prisoner boxed up and
washed down yesterday, and so on. &#8216;You&#8217;ll<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
be up on the poop for prayers at four bells,&#8217;
said he. &#8216;Lord!&#8217; he added, bursting into a
nervous laugh. &#8216;To think of only two in
this ship knowing what you are! To think
of you, a young man as habit is bringing me
to fancy you, being the real and original
Marian of the milk and buttercup holiday
times! What would mother say to see you
as you stand here now, as complete a shell-back
to the eye as that second mate there,
with a big basket of dirty dishes alongside of
you lugged all the way from the cuddy by
your own little hands? And all for love&mdash;all
for love! By glory! But the woman that
could make me dress up as a girl and follow her
to sea in a convict ship would have to sink
down straight from heaven. This earth
couldn&#8217;t manufacture her.&#8217; He rounded on his
heel and went off.</p>

<p>Some time before ten o&#8217;clock the ship&#8217;s
bell was rung; presently Mr. Balls&#8217;s silver
pipe sang in shrill whistlings through the
ship. Mr. Stiles had ordered me below to
&#8216;clean myself,&#8217; as he called it, and on my
return I followed him and Frank on to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
poop. The scene was one of extraordinary
life and full of brilliant colour. I never
can forget that picture of this first Sunday
morning I passed on board a convict
ship.</p>

<p>When I gained the poop, the ship was
crowded with people in motion. The whole
of the crew, in such clean Sunday clothes as
they could muster, were coming aft. The
convicts, in a seemingly endless procession,
were passing through the door of the hatch
and massing themselves behind the quarter-deck
barricade with their faces aft. The
guard, saving the sentries on duty, were
drawn up in a line on the poop, giving an
amazing brightness to the scene with their
red coats, shakos, and sparkling arms. Their
officers were in full dress, and the doctor in
the uniform of a surgeon of the Royal Navy.
The commander of the ship stood near the
doctor. Behind the soldiers were women and
children. Aft, at the extremity of the poop,
his figure rising and falling against the dim
azure over the stern, stood the solitary figure
of the helmsman grasping the wheel, whose<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
brass-work flamed in the sun, and abreast of
him paced the second officer, who had charge
of the ship. The sailors came tumbling up
the lee poop-ladder, and soon all the forward
portion of this raised deck was crowded with
people.</p>

<p>Such a sight as it was! But I beheld a
horror in the beauty of it. Oh, the very
spirit of horror itself entered the beauty of
that spectacle of shining ship and radiant
uniforms and glowing sea out of the mass of
human misery and sin down on that main-deck
there. I had a clear view of the
convicts. I ran my eye over the line of faces
whilst I sought for Tom, and my very heart
shrank within me at sight of the countenances
my gaze briefly settled on. Prejudice, grief
and rage may have made me find the villainous
looks of numbers more villainous than they
were. I viewed them as my sweetheart&#8217;s
associates, as ruffians and crime-laden scoundrels,
into whose vile company my honest,
pure-minded sailor, my innocent, injured
Tom, had been thrust to toil in irons with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
them, to lie at night with them, listening to
their talk.</p>

<p>The solitary occupant of the forecastle was
the sentry. He walked the deck from one
rail to the other, sometimes halting to survey
the scene. The doctor stood amidships of the
break of the poop and began to read in a loud,
firm, but slightly nasal voice from the Book
of Common Prayer. Every head was bared.
The convicts gazed intently up at the reader.
There was a pathos in the wondering, staring
looks of many of them&mdash;a something of childishness
that sat strangely on their faces, as if
their gross, unlettered ignorance was to be
astonished and pleased by the cleverness of a
man who read without difficulty, as though he
perfectly understood the meaning of what he
delivered. Barney Abram was in the front
rank of the mass of men. His gaze was fixed
on the doctor; his posture was one of humility.
I observed that he occasionally nodded as
though in appreciation when the doctor paused
upon a passage and looked at the convicts.
Tom was behind. I saw him with difficulty.
The least movement of my head blotted him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
out by bringing the heads of men in front
between us.</p>

<p>The picture was memorably impressive. I
have it now bright in my mind&#8217;s eye, all the
hues as gay as the shining colours in the silver
plate of a daguerreotype. Nothing disturbed
the stillness upon the ship but the voice of the
doctor. Yes, you heard a soft, creaming noise
of running waters, and at intervals a gentle
flap from aloft, and sometimes there would
break in a homely sound from the live-stock
forward. Never had the sea looked so wide
nor our ship so lovely. The feathering billows
ran chasing in flashes and gleams into the
south-west, where the ocean trembled in a
dark blue, with a horizon firm as though ruled
upon the delicate azure of the heavens. Southeast,
under the sun, it was all blinding splendour&mdash;sheer
dazzle that streamed to the tall,
leaning weather side of the ship and broke
from the bow in sudden light like molten
silver.</p>

<p>When the doctor had recited as much of
the Liturgy as he thought proper to deliver, he
paused to breathe a while and drink from a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
glass of water which stood at his feet. He
then began a sermon. He was in the midst of
his discourse, to which the prisoners appeared
to listen with close attention, Barney Abram
occasionally nodding in approval or admiration
as before, when a convict, who stood close
against the barricade on the port-hand side&mdash;I
mean that fore-and-aft barricade which
formed the gangway alley, as I call it&mdash;tossed
up his arms and in a loud, deep-chested,
tragedy voice cried out:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8216;I could tell a story</div>
<div class="verse">Would rouse thy lion-heart out of its den,</div>
<div class="verse">And make it rage with terrifying fury.&#8217;</div>
</div></div>

<p>The doctor stopped.</p>

<p>&#8216;Silence there!&#8217; roared a voice.</p>

<p>&#8216;Who was that?&#8217; exclaimed the doctor.</p>

<p>&#8216;Thomas Garth, sir,&#8217; responded a convict,
standing near the prisoner who had broken
out.</p>

<p>The doctor stared for a while in the direction
of the man as though waiting to see if
this extraordinary offence of interruption
would be repeated. The convict was clear
within my view; he was the tall, dark, handsome<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
man whom I supposed, and, indeed,
rightly supposed, to be the tragedian that one
of the soldiers had told me was amongst the
prisoners. After an interval of two or three
minutes, all remaining quiet, the doctor resumed;
but scarcely had he pronounced a
dozen words when I saw the actor throw up
his right arm, and, whilst he brandished his
left fist, making the strangest, maddest faces
in doing so&mdash;and at this moment I see the
lunatic fire in his eyes as he rolled them along
the line of us who stood at the break of the
poop&mdash;he burst out:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="first">&#8216;Oh, dismal! &#8217;Tis not to be borne! Ye moralists!</div>
<div class="verse">Ye talkers! What are all your precepts now?</div>
<div class="verse">Patience! Distraction! Blast the tyrant, blast him!</div>
<div class="verse">Avenging lightnings, snatch him hence, ye fiends!</div>
<div class="indent">Nature can bear no more.&#8217;</div>
</div></div>

<p>&#8216;Seize that man!&#8217; roared the doctor, who
seemed instantly to understand what had come
to the unhappy wretch.</p>

<p>But a man who goes on a sudden raving-mad
is not very easily seized. This convict
was immensely strong; his chest, bulk, and
stature were assurance of that. All in a
moment half a dozen prisoners were rolling<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
upon the deck, beaten down by the madman&#8217;s
fists and elbows as though they had been
children. With agility that might be possible
only to such madness as was in him, the man
sprang, grasped the top of the barricade, and
with a kick of his feet vaulted into the gangway
between. He ran a few yards forward,
sprang upon a scuttle-butt and gained the
bulwarks, on which he stood erect, holding
by nothing, swaying his fine figure with the
movements of the ship, laughing the shocking
laughter of madness and shaking his clenched
fists at the poop.</p>

<p>&#8216;Seize him!&#8217; shrieked the doctor, nearly
throwing me as he rushed to the poop-ladder.</p>

<p>&#8216;Come down!&#8217; roared the sentry on the
forecastle, and the bayonet flashed as he swept
his piece from his shoulder to level it.</p>

<p>&#8216;Quick, or he&#8217;ll be overboard!&#8217; bawled
Captain Sutherland.</p>

<p>The swaying figure on the bulwark-rail
roared with maniac laughter.</p>

<p>&#8216;Come down, or I&#8217;ll fire!&#8217; shouted the
forecastle sentry.</p>

<p>&#8216;He&#8217;s mad! He&#8217;s mad!&#8217; went up in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
very thunder of noise from the mass of the
convicts.</p>

<p>It was then that I heard Captain Barrett
cry to the sentry not to fire; but the man
did not hear; he stood at a considerable distance
from the poop, and the roar of the convicts
was in the air as the captain shouted.
The soldier fired. I screamed with the voice
of a woman when I beheld the spit of the
flame and the blue wreath of the smoke.</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, Jesu!&#8217; cried the convict. He turned
slowly, as though to look at the man who had
shot him, and fell backward into the sea.</p>

<p>The women behind the line of guards
shrieked, and some of them fainted. My
knees failed me, and I sank down in the horror
of that moment, clutching at a stanchion
of the brass rail. Captain Barrett delivered
an order swiftly and fiercely, and the armed
guard came with a hurried tramp to the brass
rail, the outermost one on the left thrusting
me with his foot to get me out of the road.
Sick and terrified as I was, my wits were sufficiently
collected to mark an ugly movement
among the prisoners, an indescribable stir of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
figures, quick turnings of the face and eyes,
as though the many-headed beast sniffed blood
and saw its chance. It might have been that
they were enraged by the slaying of the
maniac, yet nothing more sinister, nothing
more deeply tragic in its suggestions than
that stir of agitation, those sudden, wild, eager
looks and movements of the head could be
imagined.</p>

<p>The man had fallen overboard on the
weather side of the ship. The sailors assembled
on the poop rushed to the rail when the
man reeled and dropped; they shouted as they
stood looking; the captain sped to the grating
abaft the wheel and gazed astern there, calling
to know if anyone saw anything of the man.
Twenty throats were bawling: some saw him;
some said he had gone down like lead; some
that he had been shot through the heart, and
that there would be nothing to pick up.
Meanwhile the ship was sweeping swiftly and
smoothly onward; the white brine spun in
sheets past the quarters, and the ridged seas
of the trade-wind beat their plumes of snow
into showerings of spray against the coppered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
bends of the heeling vessel. The spread of
canvas was great&mdash;the studding-sails were out
besides. The seamen would have needed a
clear deck to bring the ship to the wind, and
the convicts still stood massed, covered and
overawed by the soldiers at the line of the
break of the poop&mdash;every man so grasping
his musket as to be ready to take aim at the
word of command.</p>

<p>The time was wild with confusion and
terror; the sailors continued to shout as they
looked astern. Some of the children were
yelling loudly with fright on the poop; sharp,
harsh cries resounded from the main-deck,
where I saw the doctor thrusting in amongst
the convicts, whilst a few of the men whom
he had appointed &#8216;captains&#8217; appeared to be
shoving and pushing and marshalling the prisoners
so as to form them into some sort of
marching order for the descent of the main
hatch.</p>

<p>Captain Sutherland came hastily forward
to the rail and looked down upon the convicts.
He then shouted to his chief mate, who was
standing near a quarter-boat to windward.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>&#8216;Send all hands forward, Mr. Bates!
Send all hands forward, sir! There&#8217;s nothing
to be done!&#8217; and he motioned significantly
toward the main-deck.</p>

<p>And, indeed, until the convicts were all in
their quarters below, nothing was to have been
done, for the seamen must have gone amongst
them to haul and drag upon certain of the
gear. At the foot of the mainmast, for
example, were belayed many ropes, all belonging
to the vast spread of sail stretching
on high overhead, and this mast stood within
the barricades. What might have happened
had the sailors rushed in amongst the convicts
to bring the ship to the wind?</p>

<p>Captain Sutherland stood pale and still
at the head of the poop-ladder; the ship&#8217;s
company were streaming forward through the
gangway galley, and when I quitted the poop
in the tail of the procession of women and
children, the captain, the officers, and the line
of soldiers, who stood in a posture to instantly
cover the convicts, alone remained on that
deck.</p>

<p>I stood in the recess along with Frank and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
some of the soldiers&#8217; wives, waiting to see what
was going to happen within the barricades.
One of the convicts had been killed or stunned
by the maniac, and lay as motionless as a log.
The sentinel who had shot the man trudged
the forecastle with frequent looks in the direction
of the main-deck, as though prepared at
any instant for a call to level his piece afresh.
The women near me jabbered incessantly, and
every tongue wagged in defence of Murphy,
as they called the soldier.</p>

<p>&#8216;God pity me!&#8217; exclaimed Frank, looking
at the woman. &#8216;But it vhas murder to shoot
a madman.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Mind your own business!&#8217; cried one of
the women, angrily. &#8216;It&#8217;s the duty of a soldier
to obey orders, and the orders of a sentry
are to shoot down any convict who gets over
the barricade and attempts to leave the ship.
So there!&#8217; she cried spitefully. I believe she
was Murphy&#8217;s wife. &#8216;How was the sentry to
know he was mad? If a soldier don&#8217;t obey
orders he stands to be shot himself. So
there.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;It vhas murder,&#8217; said Frank, and, smiting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
his thigh, he cried, &#8216;she makes my blood
boil.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;If you calls it murder again,&#8217; said another
of the women, &#8216;I&#8217;ll speak to the sergeant, and
he shall talk to you. You&#8217;re a low German
fellow, and us soldiers&#8217; wives are not to be insulted
by the likes of you.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;So there!&#8217; cried the woman who had
just spoken, spitting the words at the young
fellow.</p>

<p>Meanwhile sharp orders were being delivered
within the barricade. I took my chance
of being reprimanded from the poop and went
a little way along the alley, and saw all the
convicts still massed, but in motion; they
were descending the hatch, but one at a time,
for there was room for no more. The body
of the fellow who had been stunned was held
by four of the prisoners. The doctor stood
alone and apart within the inclosure, looking
at the men as they swarmed slowly toward the
main-hatch, filtering to their quarters. He
was white, but stern and collected. Sometimes
he spoke, pointing or moving his hand
as though to insist on more order. He seemed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
a fearless figure, and though I disliked him, I
could not but admire him. There were scores,
perhaps, amongst those felons who would have
made no more of felling him and kicking
out his brains than of dashing an egg to the
deck.</p>

<p>I did not see Tom, so I went back to the
recess, and just then an apprentice struck six
bells. Ten minutes later, every convict was
below and the main-deck clear; but I observed
that when the guard came off the poop one of
the soldiers passed through the quarter-deck
gate to double the sentry at the main-hatch,
and I heard another tell one of the women,
as he went below to the barracks, that he was
to do duty as second sentry at the prison door
of the steerage bulkhead.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVII<br />


<small>SHE LISTENS TO A CONVERSATION</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">All</span> the time I was in the cuddy that day,
whilst the captain and officers lunched, I kept
my ears open, supposing that the talk would
wholly concern the dreadful, tragic incident
of the morning. But no man said a word on
the subject. Perhaps they had talked it out
before they came to the table, or perhaps they
would not speak of it before me and the other
stewards. I was greatly disappointed. I
wanted to hear that the sentry had exceeded his
instructions and was to be severely punished.
It was horrible that a man should be empowered
to shoot down a fellow-creature as the
sentry shot down the poor mad actor. I had
hoped that Captain Sutherland, whose heart
was a British sailor&#8217;s, would ask the doctor
and the officers why a sentry should be instructed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
to fire at a man for no worse crime
than scaling a barricade and climbing on to
the bulwarks of the ship. To kill a man for
so behaving might be all very well in harbour,
where a convict could contrive to swim
ashore. But what dream of liberty could
visit an unhappy wretch in mid-ocean, unless
it were the freedom that death provides?
And why should a convict be shot for attempting
suicide? Out of mercy, that his blood
might be upon the head of another instead of
on his own?</p>

<p>The cool chatter of the officers upon light,
frivolous topics filled me with wrath. I
wanted to hear them talk of the shooting of
the madman. But nothing was said. No
reference was made to that strange, threatening
stir which had been visible amongst the
convicts, like the passing of a sudden darkness
over a waving field of grain. The doctor
was very stern. He ate little and talked
seldom. Only once did I catch the least
allusion to that morning&#8217;s bloody business. I
was coming up from the pantry with some
glasses, when I heard Captain Sutherland<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span>
say, &#8216;By-the-by, how is the man that was
knocked down?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;All right again,&#8217; answered the doctor.</p>

<p>&#8216;He lay like a corpse,&#8217; said the captain.</p>

<p>&#8216;He was stunned,&#8217; said the doctor. And
then Captain Barrett spoke, and the subject
was changed.</p>

<p>I went forward that night after dark, when
my work was done, knowing it was Will&#8217;s
watch below, and wishful for a chat with him.
He lay, smoking, upon a chest in his cabin,
and an apprentice swung overhead in a hammock,
with one leg dangling down. I could
not converse before that fellow up there,
though nothing would have been thought had
I entered and sat down beside Will, for it was
gone about that he knew me through his father
having had mine for a client.</p>

<p>He saw me by the light of the slush lamp
that sootily burned against the bulkhead near
the door, nodded, and, filling his pipe afresh,
lighted it and lounged out. We leaned against
the ship&#8217;s galley to leeward, where all was
quiet.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>&#8216;What have you to tell me about this
morning&#8217;s fearful job?&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;A sweet experience for you, my honey,&#8217;
said he. &#8216;See what&#8217;s to be learned by stowing
oneself away in a convict ship.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What will they do to the soldier who
killed the man?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Do to him? Give him a stripe to wear
on his arm when they get ashore.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;It was a brutal murder!&#8217; I exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8216;You say that because your sympathies
are below. Duty&#8217;s no murder. The man
obeyed orders, and very right orders they are.
Let me tell you, my daisy, there&#8217;s a very considerable
slice of hell stowed away under
hatches in this ship; and if it wasn&#8217;t for the
guffies, there&#8217;d be such a blaze as &#8217;ud make
you, for one, wish Stepney were closer aboard
than it is.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Do you mean to tell me,&#8217; said I, &#8216;that
twenty soldiers in command of half a man
and a puppy can keep two hundred and thirty
desperate, fearless, crime-hardened ruffians
under?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Two hundred and thirty! That figure<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
counts Butler as one of the beauties, eh?&#8217; said
he, laughing. &#8216;But I answer yes; twenty
soldiers can do it, backed, of course, by our
machinery of barricades, manholes, and the
rest of it, not to mention a moral influence
that counts more usefully than a great gun
loaded chock-a-block with scissors and thumbscrews.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;If those convicts had found a leader to-day,&#8217;
said I, &#8216;they would have seized the ship.&#8217;</p>

<p>He turned his head about in the gloom to
see if anybody was near.</p>

<p>&#8216;Seize the ship!&#8217; he exclaimed with a
little snort of contempt. &#8216;With a file of soldiers
splendidly placed ready to fire amongst the
devils as fast as they could load! With three
sentries in addition to help! With officers
and a crew ready to support the soldiers!
But, hang me,&#8217; said he, with a change of voice
and peering close into my face to catch a sight
of me, &#8216;if I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;re sorry the ship
wasn&#8217;t seized!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I wish you didn&#8217;t excuse the diabolical
murder. I&#8217;d shoot that sentry with my own
hand for killing a poor, unhappy madman<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
goaded into insanity, for all you know, by an
unjust sentence. It might have been Tom.
Suppose Tom&#8217;s heart broke and his mind went?
A soldier would shoot him!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;D&#8217;ye know you hiss when you talk?
I used to like your spirit, but love is
making a tigress of you. You make a fellow
afraid?&#8217;</p>

<p>But I had not come to talk with him to do
that. I wanted news, and he had none; and
I had no idea of scaring or disgusting the dear
lad by causing him to fancy that my sympathies
were with the felons under hatches when
I had a heart but for one man only in the
whole world. Will was just the sort of lad to
betray me that I might not come to harm or
harm others; so, after laughing at his likening
me to a tigress, I talked of Stepney and his
father&#8217;s house near the Tower, and in a few
minutes the pair of us were happy in old, kind,
gentle memories.</p>

<p>He grew a little inquisitive presently, however,
and asked me some questions.</p>

<p>&#8216;Have you thought of what you mean to
do when you arrive at Hobart Town?&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>&#8216;I shall be guided entirely by what is done
with Tom,&#8217; I answered.</p>

<p>&#8216;Shall you settle in Tasmania?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Somewhere in that part of the world,&#8217; I
said. &#8216;Once a convict, always a convict. I
know Tom and his proud heart; if his innocence
could be established on his arrival
and liberty given to him, he&#8217;d not return
home. He hates England&mdash;I&#8217;ll swear it. And
I hate home for his sake.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;You&#8217;ll sell your house in Stepney, I
suppose!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes, I may do that. There&#8217;s much I
may do. I shall be guided by what befalls
Tom. I have money enough to establish ourselves
in comfort. We shall want for nothing
in our new home.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Maybe I shall turn squatter, myself,&#8217;
said Will. &#8216;There&#8217;s a big thing to be done
in wool. But give me New South Wales. I
wish they had sent Butler there. What&#8217;s
become of the <i>Arab Chief</i>, I wonder? And
does he lose all the money he invested in
her?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;No,&#8217; said I.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>Here some seamen came and lolled alongside
of us; we could talk no more, so I went
aft.</p>

<p>All next day the doctor was full of business.
I heard him tell the captain at the
breakfast-table what the routine was to be:
at half-past eight prayers and a portion of
the Scriptures were to be read to the prisoners
in divisions, some below, some on deck, as
the weather might permit; then schools were
to be formed, but this could not be done
until the doctor had ascertained the ability of
the prisoners to read&mdash;he needed time to put
a book into each man&#8217;s hand to test him.
Every school would consist of nine or ten
pupils; schoolmasters would be selected from
the best educated of the convicts. School
would be held morning and afternoon; after
supper, at four o&#8217;clock, the doctor would
regularly deliver a lecture on any subject
likely to improve and enlighten his hearers.</p>

<p>You&#8217;ll suppose he was a busy man. Indeed!
he had a hundred things to see to.
Besides the schools, the lectures and the like,
exercise had to be arranged for, the washing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
of linen, airing of bedding and so forth.
Then there was the hospital to visit, troublesome
convicts to examine and punish, a
journal to write up, and I know not what
besides. This, the first Monday of fine weather
and freedom of irons, was spent by him in
planning the convict routine for the voyage.
I collected from his talk at the table that the
prisoners were very quiet, and looking forward
with interest to the educational work he was
cutting out for them. He told Captain
Sutherland he had addressed them below very
seriously on the Sunday morning&#8217;s tragic
business; in fact at lunch he spoke out
without reserve.</p>

<p>&#8216;I was impressed,&#8217; said he, &#8216;by the
thoughtful looks of many of the unhappy
people when I bade them accept the death
of the poor, miserable man Garth as an awful
warning&mdash;not in respect of discipline, not in
respect of the penalty that attaches to insubordination,
but in regard to their souls&#8217;
health.&#8217; And then he occupied ten minutes
in repeating what he had said to the convicts.
Lieutenant Chimmo hemmed and tried to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
break through the dull prosing; but the
doctor loved his own eloquence too well to
let his companions off a single sentence
that he could recollect. &#8216;I believe,&#8217;
said he, &#8216;that there is some good in that
man Barney Abram, after all. I observed
that he was very attentive at Divine service
yesterday.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;But he is not of your persuasion, surely?&#8217;
said Captain Sutherland.</p>

<p>&#8216;He&#8217;s of the persuasion of them all,&#8217;
answered the doctor.</p>

<p>&#8216;The persuasion that has the devil for
high priest, eh, Ellice?&#8217; said Captain Barrett.</p>

<p>&#8216;That&#8217;s so,&#8217; said the doctor. &#8216;Barney
Abram is a man I should be proud and thankful
to bring over. He was a very bad lot at
home. This ship might not hold all the
wretches he has tempted and ruined. Yet I
seemed to find an expression of contrition in
the fellow&#8217;s face, a softening look as though
he might not prove so inaccessible as I had
feared. He asked leave to speak to me before
I came up from below this morning, and I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span>
was gratified to understand that his object
was to thank me for the remarks I had
offered to the prisoners on the subject of the
sudden appalling death of Garth.&#8217;</p>

<p>Captain Barrett burst into one of his
great laughs, for which he apologised by
saying that he was thinking of a story he had
heard of Barney; it was not fit to repeat,
however.</p>

<p>&#8216;Then, sir,&#8217; said the doctor, sternly, &#8216;we&#8217;ll
not trouble you for it.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Whisper,&#8217; said the subaltern, side-long,
to his brother-officer.</p>

<p>&#8216;Have you given the prize-fighter any
sort of appointment, doctor?&#8217; said Captain
Sutherland.</p>

<p>&#8216;Not yet. I have my eye on him. His
immense strength will make him useful.
He may end as my first captain. Had he
stood near the madman, the poor fellow
would now be alive. Abram is, perhaps, the
only man in the ship who could have grasped
and held him.&#8217;</p>

<p>He then talked of his schools. His head
was full of the thing. I learned, through<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
listening, that the Admiralty instructions provided
for the establishment of schools and
religious teaching.</p>

<p>After the doctor had made all his arrangements
on this Monday, nothing happened of
any consequence that I can recall for some time.
We carried a strong north-east trade-wind,
and we drove along by day and by night,
with foam sometimes lifting to the cathead.
There was scarcely need to handle a rope, so
fresh and steady was the trade-wind, with its
wool-white clouds scattering like sheep down
the sky and the horizon bright and hard and
blue in the windy distance. At times I
caught sight of Tom. The intervals were
wide, and I never found an opportunity to
breathe so much as a syllable of love to him.
And this was very well. It was enough that
he knew I was on board, and that we were
able sometimes to see each other. I never
attempted to write a second letter. The risk of
delivering it was too great, and I was resolved
to run no risks, lest some act that would add
nothing to Tom&#8217;s happiness nor mine should
betray me and extinguish my hopes, nay,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
slay my chance of reaching Tasmania with
him in the same ship.</p>

<p>Sometimes I feared my sex was dimly
suspected, but mainly my mind was at rest
on that score. The persons I was afraid of
were the two military men and the German
steward. The idea of my being a woman, I
am sure, never entered the doctor&#8217;s mind.
Had he entertained the least suspicion, he
was just the man to settle it out of hand by
sending me down among the soldiers&#8217; wives
to be examined. And yet, when I peeped at
myself in one of the long cuddy mirrors, I&#8217;d
wonder at the success of my masquerade. I
repeat here that I was a very fine figure of a
woman. In none of the points which are
admirable in the equipment of the best shaped
of my sex was I lacking. Yet it is certain
that my impersonation was perfect, and that,
if I except the three men I have named, there
was not a man in the ship who by looks or
speech caused me the least anxiety.</p>

<p>However, to provide against the reasons
of my being on board becoming known,
should detection of my sex happen unexpectedly,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
I sought out Will one evening, and had
a long, earnest chat with him. I put it to
him thus:</p>

<p>&#8216;You are supposed to know me; that is
to say, you are supposed to know that I am
the son of a man who was a client of your
father. Suddenly I am discovered to be a
girl. The captain sends for you, and you are
challenged in the presence of the doctor.
What will you say?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;That&#8217;s where it is,&#8217; said he. &#8216;Make one
false step, and ten to one if you&#8217;re not
presently up to your neck.&#8217;</p>

<p>He scratched his head and mused, staring
at me. I would not help him. I wished to
test the quality of his wits in case he should
be challenged as I have said. After a bit, he
exclaimed:</p>

<p>&#8216;I should disown all knowledge of you.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;That&#8217;s good,&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8217;d say you told me your name was
Simon Marlowe and that your father was a
client of my father&#8217;s. I should tell no lie by
owning I believed the story, because, you see,
uncle was a client of the dad&#8217;s. Well,&#8217; he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
went on, &#8216;I should tell them that now you
proved to be a girl, you weren&#8217;t the young
fellow I took you for, and I should call you a
liar and disown all knowledge of you.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;And in saying so you&#8217;d be strictly speaking
the truth, so far as Simon Marlowe is
concerned,&#8217; said I, rejoiced to find him so
ready. &#8216;You&#8217;ll disown me. You&#8217;ll call me
a liar. You&#8217;ll know nothing whatever about
me. That&#8217;ll be the programme, Will, should
you be called upon.&#8217;</p>

<p>We stood discussing the matter some
time, and then separated, but I was mightily
glad to have had this talk with him.</p>

<small>SHE OVERHEARS TWO SAILORS TALKING</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> many days we met with very beautiful
weather, and every day the sun grew hotter
and hotter. The moon enlarged and became
a full moon, and the prospect of the dark
blue night, with the moon shining higher in
the heavens than ever I had seen her shine,
and the stars in multitudes of brilliants
trembling in a very sheet of silver down to
the vague, obscure line of the horizon, was
glorious and wonderful. Often on those fine
nights, instead of going to bed, I&#8217;d creep to
the forecastle, where nobody walked but the
sentry and a seaman on the look-out. There
I would overhang the head rail and gaze
down at the star-white foam as it spread out
with a soft, boiling noise from the steady,
shearing thrust of the cutwater. The sea
was full of fire and many strange shapes of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
dim, greenish flame swept past in the black
water as I looked. The moonlight lay upon
the sails and they rose stirless as carvings in
marble. The stars glittered like jewels in the
dark arches under the sails and twinkled
gem-like along the black lines of the yards,
and danced like the mystic fire of the corposant
beyond the trucks to the swaying of the
fragile points of masthead.</p>

<p>Oh, it was at such times as these that I
longed for Tom! What happiness, I would
think, to have his hand in mine; to be standing
here at his side, gazing up with him at
the moon-whitened canvas, or watching the
sea-fire leaping in sparks amidst the rushing
froth on either hand! He had talked once of
my going a voyage with him. He had talked,
too, of his carrying me to sea when we were
married. I could understand what I had lost
when I stood lonely on that dark forecastle
watching the yearning breasts of canvas leaning
from the wind and thinking of the home
that was low down behind the sea. My heart
beat with passion when, on these lovely moonlight
nights, sweet with the strong blowing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
of the trade-wind, I&#8217;d think of my dear one
locked up in the &#8217;tweendecks below&mdash;imprisoned
with the rest of them since half-past six,
to emerge from the pestilential atmosphere at
daybreak&mdash;for what?</p>

<p>Whilst I thus thought, I&#8217;d clench my
hands in the agony of my mind till the nails
were driven into the palms of them.</p>

<p>But everything went along very quietly.
Tables were knocked together, and schools
held on deck in the inclosure; that is, a proportion
of the schools. There was not room
for all, and the convict classes alternated
between the &#8217;tweendecks and the main-deck.
The doctor speedily found out that Tom was
one of the best educated of the prisoners, and
set him to help in teaching the many wretches
who knew not their alphabet. But it rarely
happened, as I have said, that I saw my
sweetheart. Either I was at work in the
cuddy when he was on deck, or he was below,
or the schools broken up when I might have
found leisure to watch him.</p>

<p>I often speculated upon the histories of
the many convicts&mdash;chose a face and mused<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
upon it. My conviction&mdash;nay, my knowledge&mdash;that
Tom was as innocent as I of the crime
for which he was being transported made me
think that there might be others as guiltless
as he; and this sort of fancy or sympathy
often raised a passion of pity in me as I&#8217;d
stand staring at a convict, striving to fetch
his life-story out of his face, though, for all I
knew, the man I watched might have been
one of the very worst scoundrels in the ship.</p>

<p>What affected me most was the guessing
that lots of them must have left wives and
mothers, children and dear ones behind. I
had heard the doctor say that not above one
out of every one hundred convicts ever
returned home, so that, unless the parents or
the wives of the poor, miserable felons followed
them, they would be as completely sundered
from home ties as though they had been sentenced
to the gallows instead of to the hulks
and transport. My eyes would moisten sometimes
in thus thinking whilst I watched a
prisoner in some hour of leisure, fancying a
past for him. Once I saw this: Two children
belonging to the soldiers had strayed into the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
gangway alley and were playing there. I
observed a convict, a middle-aged man, watching
them. A sudden spasm contorted his
face. He jerked down his hand in a snapping
way, in some instant anguish of memory, as
though he cast something from him, and
turned his head and moved a few paces, then
raised his cuff to his eye, with a look-round
afterward to see if he was noticed.</p>

<p>One evening I went forward, meaning to
get upon the forecastle to breathe the air. It
was hot in the recess. Some women were
seated round the booby-hatch, and the noise
of the children vexed the mood I was then in.
It was toward the close of the second dog-watch
and dark. I saw some figures on the
forecastle, and learnt by the voices that Mr.
Stiles, Mr. Balls, and the sailmaker were of
them. Therefore, that I might be private,
meaning to breathe in solitude upon the forecastle
later on, I went round to the lee side of
the galley, the door of which was closed, and
stood there, looking at the dark sea above
the line of the bulwark-rail, for the ship was
heeling over somewhat sharply this night.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span>Though the noise of the pouring and
foaming brine rose shrill and strong, other
sounds were very plainly to be heard. For
instance, I often caught what they said upon
the forecastle, though the speakers were at a
distance. The main-deck was empty. A few
figures moved about the poop. Presently
two sailors stationed themselves against the
foremost end of the galley, round the corner,
so to say, facing the lofty pillar of the foremast.
I smelt the fumes of their coarse tobacco.
They could not see me nor I them;
but what they said was as distinct as though
they stood alongside of me, spite of their
speaking in subdued voices. I knew not who
they were, but guessed them to be two forecastle
hands.</p>

<p>&#8216;I had a yarn along with Bob this morning,&#8217;
said one of them. &#8216;Them gallus sentries
are made up of eyes. Fust time I&#8217;ve been
able to speak to him.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What&#8217;s he lagged for?&#8217; said the other
man.</p>

<p>&#8216;Buzzlement. I knew it &#8217;ud happen. He
grew too confident and was ate up with pride.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
He might be helping himself now, theayters
and dancin&#8217; kens as often as you like, lush to
swim in and quids for his piece. But the
gallus fool must grow greedy; he takes too
big a handful, and now he&#8217;s outward-bound.
But twelve bob a week and find himself! A
covey with Bob&#8217;s tastes, too, mind ye, and one
of your gallus high-flyers to rig out. But he
says he ain&#8217;t sorry it&#8217;s over. He never felt
comfortable. His piece was always a-scolding
and threatening to split if the swag warn&#8217;t
forthcoming; and, blow me, she stumped
him, after all, for split she did, but not afore
she&#8217;d got another cully, in tow, unbeknown to
Bob, you take your oath.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I heard Micky Volkins,&#8217; said the other,
&#8216;a-telling Bill Flanders that he squeezed in a
yarn with his old chum when they was washing
down. They scrubbed side by side.
Micky says the old chum&#8217;s glad to be going
abroad. The shore-work took it out of him,
but the hulk gave satisfaction. The feeding
was beef, soup, mutton, spuds, bread, porridge,
and treacle. I recollect the boiling. If a
man&#8217;s sick, they put him on sheep&#8217;s head,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
eggs, soft puddens, tea and butter, along with
brandy and wine, which they sarve out by
the hounce. Is that sailors&#8217; fare? Strike my
eyes if it ain&#8217;t good enough to go into irons
for!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;There&#8217;s only one sailor-man among &#8217;em,
Bob was a-saying,&#8217; said the first sailor.</p>

<p>&#8216;Who&#8217;s he?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Didn&#8217;t hear his name. Lagged for
scuttling a vessel. Gallus good job if the
old man tried it on with this ship. Everything&#8217;s
blooming wrong. All the work comes
upon a few. What&#8217;s good goes below;
what&#8217;s stinking&#8217;s sent for&#8217;ard. Well, I never
shipped expecting to see Bob, and I&#8217;m game
to swap places, if they&#8217;ll consent. Look
what&#8217;s done for &#8217;em! Prayer-meetin&#8217;s, eddication
up to the knocker, a doctor to physic
&#8217;em! If a man growls, he&#8217;s spoke to as a
man. One of the convicts complained to the
doctor of the cooking. The gent sniffed and
tasted, said the man was right and winged the
gallus cook. Let e&#8217;er a one of us lay aft, and
what&#8217;s a-goin to happen?&#8217;</p>

<p>The conversation was at this point interrupted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
by the second sailor beginning to
sneeze. He sneezed at least twenty times
with a great roaring noise. Mr. Balls came
to the edge of the forecastle and cried down:
&#8216;Withered if there ain&#8217;t a grampus jumped
aboard!&#8217; The fit of sneezing passed, and the
fellow lighted his pipe afresh, and the men
resumed their conversation.</p>

<p>&#8216;It&#8217;s gallus queer,&#8217; said the first speaker,
&#8216;that there should be only one sailor among
&#8217;em.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;One navigator, perhaps,&#8217; said the other.</p>

<p>&#8216;Well, that may be. I wish they was all
ships&#8217; captains for my part&mdash;skippers and
mates. I&#8217;m gallus glad whenever I hear a
skipper&#8217;s lagged. But they&#8217;re too leary,
bully. Ha, ha! They knows how to keep
to wind&#8217;ard, scrape and go as it often is.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What&#8217;s the coveys made up of?&#8217; said the
second speaker.</p>

<p>&#8216;I asked Bob that. &#8220;All sorts,&#8221; said he.
&#8220;One&#8217;s a parson.&#8221;&#8217; Here both sailors laughed
loudly. &#8216;A harbour missionary, lagged for
fishing through the slit in the mission box.&#8217;
Both men laughed loudly again. &#8216;You&#8217;ll know<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
him, maty, by singling out the cove as carries
his hands as though he wore long thread
gloves. Bob told me to twig him by that.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Only one sea-captain?&#8217; said the second
speaker. &#8216;It must be the next ship, then,
that&#8217;s a-bringing of them out?&#8217;</p>

<p>Eight bells at this moment were struck;
the boatswain sent some thrilling message
through the ship with his pipe; and, unwilling
that the two speakers should know that
I had been a listener, I went softly round the
galley and made my way aft.</p>

<p>The reference to Tom in this conversation
had struck me as strange. The men undoubtedly
meant Tom when they spoke of
one of the convicts as the only sea-captain
amongst the prisoners. How should that be
known? The doctor was doubtless acquainted
with the felons&#8217; antecedents, but he never
talked and rarely answered questions. The
convicts, then, had made the discovery
amongst themselves; this I thought extraordinary.
Tom might have admitted his
calling to the fellows who shared his sleeping
berth, to the prisoners who formed the mess<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
he was in; but how should it be known to
two hundred and twenty-nine convicts that
the two hundred and thirtieth was the
only sea-captain amongst them? Perhaps I
mistook; a few had learned Tom&#8217;s calling,
and one of those few had talked with the
sailor whose conversation with his mate I had
listened to.</p>

<p>I did not give the matter much thought;
I should have given it much less thought had
not Tom been the man the sailors referred to.
That some of the sailors should have found
friends amongst the prisoners was quite in
keeping with the looks of a few of the crew.
I had often thought that were the forecastle
hands to shift clothes with the malefactors,
they would make wickeder-looking convicts
than the bulk of the prisoners.</p>

<small>SHE IS ALARMED BY WHAT IS SAID BY THE
OFFICERS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> convict ship <i>Childe Harold</i> drove steadily
down the North Atlantic with the trade-wind,
and then, losing those prosperous gales something
north of the Equator, crept stealthily
through a wide, white, gleaming zone of
calms, blurred with fainting catspaws as a
mirror is dimmed by the breath. No incident
of any sort broke the profound monotony
of the routine of shipboard life. Captain
Barrett and the subaltern killed the time by
firing at a mark with pistols, by cards, chess,
deck quoits, fishing for sharks, and the like.
Their duties were trifling. The sergeant of
the guard seemed to do all the work. The
discipline of the sea had the regularity of the
tick of a clock. Sights were punctually
taken, the log hove, the watch relieved&mdash;so it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
went on. The crew came and went to the
sound of Balls&#8217;s pipe or to the warning voice
of the officer of the watch.</p>

<p>I was now looking very close into the sea
life, and was of opinion that it was a sickening,
tedious calling. The atmosphere of
romance which had coloured my early
thoughts of it, got from my father&#8217;s and his
friends&#8217; merry or wild or exciting yarns, had
perished out of my mind long before we were
up with the Equator, as the term is. The
captain was burdened with enormous responsibilities.
The safety of a large, valuable
ship freighted with human lives was dependent
upon him, and his pay was perhaps less
than the wages of a head-waiter of a City
tavern. The mates were at the mercy of the
captain, who could break them if he chose,
send them forward to do common sailor&#8217;s
work and ruin them. They lived without
friendship. One was superior to the other.
The captain addressed them only on matters
of ship work, and talked familiarly with
nobody but the doctor and military officers.
There were three mates. Two of them led<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
lives as lonely as the ship&#8217;s figure-head; the
third, who was a person of no consequence,
would carry his pipe into the boatswain&#8217;s
or apprentices&#8217; berth, and so kill time for
himself.</p>

<p>I had not guessed that this was the life of
the deep when I used to listen to the ocean
talk of my father&#8217;s friends at Stepney or view
the ships in the Thames, and create a fairy
sea with rich skies and spicy breezes for them
to sail over. It was my acquaintance, however,
with the forecastle side of the life that
completely ruined my idealism. I could not
wonder that sailors should be the mutinous
and growling dogs they are represented when
I peeped into the forecastle and smelt the
smells and blinked at the gloom and beheld
the damp and the dirt, the half-clad figures
of men who had shipped without a shift of
clothes and whose wage would not bring
them within hail of the slop-chest; when I
saw the lumps of green pork or blue and iron
beef carried from the galley into the forecastle
along with the slush-thick peasoup or the
dingy, bolster-hard duff at which any famished<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
mongrel of the London streets might hiccough.</p>

<p>&#8216;Is it the same everywhere at sea?&#8217; I
once asked Will.</p>

<p>&#8216;No,&#8217; he answered, &#8216;the crew are well fed
and well treated aboard us&mdash;comparatively
speaking,&#8217; he added, with a grin.</p>

<p>&#8216;And do you like the life?&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;The country must have sailors, young
woman?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I would rather be a convict,&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;Yet it was not always thus, you know,
my pretty Mary Jane,&#8217; he exclaimed, singing.
&#8216;When Butler was a sailor you nailed your
heart to the foremast; now he&#8217;s a convict
you want to clank it through life, eh?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;It was not always thus, Mary Jane,
because I had never been to sea. I read in
books and listened to talk and painted on
clouds. Now I am at sea. I have watched
the life and swear that I would rather take
a convict&#8217;s discipline along with a convict&#8217;s
chances than be a foremast hand.&#8217;</p>

<p>My work was light, and this was a wonderful
mercy, seeing that I had been made a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
cuddy-servant without anybody knowing I
was a girl. I washed glasses, fetched and
carried dishes, cleaned knives and plate and
so on. This was no more than housemaid&#8217;s
work, down even to the scrubbing of the
deck, which was the same as washing the
floor of a room. Added to this, I slept alone
in a comfortable cabin and had all such conveniences
as a young woman who masquerades
as a boy could need.</p>

<p>I was nearly of Will&#8217;s height, and his
clothes fitted me, and when the weather grew
very hot I wore his flannel shirts, serge jacket
buttoned up to conceal my figure, and white
drill trousers. I also got him to buy me a
new grass hat from one of the sailors, and
thus attired, I looked the smartest, sauciest
young fellow that ever stepped the decks of a
ship. The captain and the mates knew how
I came by the clothes I wore, and asked no
questions.</p>

<p>The Woolwich apparel remained in the
upper bunk. Long before this I had opened
it and inspected the contents, and found every
article as I had packed it. It was a very<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>
large bundle; it contained my hat and bodice
and skirt and the under-linen and shoes I
had removed when I dressed myself as a
boy.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the doctor was highly satisfied
with the progress the convict school-classes
were making. He would come to the table
and rub his hands and declare, with one of
his grave smiles, that since such and such a
date So-and-so&mdash;and here, perhaps, he would
give the initials of a convict or quote several
examples by their initials only&mdash;had got the
Lord&#8217;s Prayer by heart and was beginning
to pronounce words of two and even three
syllables. I am sure he was a benevolent,
good, pious man, but repulsive to my sympathies
by sternness and officialism and, perhaps,
by the thought that Tom was under him, in
his power, of no more account than the rest
of the prisoners, many of whom were being
transported for vile and some for diabolical
crimes.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d keep my ears open to hear if he spoke
of Tom; but he never uttered my sweetheart&#8217;s
name nor indicated him by any fashion of his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
own. Strange to relate, one of his favourites
was now the prize-fighter Barney Abram. It
puzzled me to imagine by what acts this man
Abram had succeeded in gaining the doctor&#8217;s
good opinion and confidence. Certainly
during service no man was so attentive as the
prize-fighter. I see him now with his head
slightly on one side, his eyes fixed upon the
doctor with an expression of half-complacent
admiration, as though what he heard was not
only doing him good but amazing him with
the beauty and eloquence with which it was
delivered. Then I gathered that Barney was
very zealous in the school-work. I remember
the doctor telling Captain Barrett that the
tears stood in the prize-fighter&#8217;s eyes whilst he
expressed his gratitude for the opportunities
provided by the discipline of the convict ship
for improving his understanding and qualifying
him to think and reason as a rational, responsible
being. Captain Barrett looked silently
at the doctor through his eye-glass; but immediately
the doctor had quitted the table
the captain turned to Lieutenant Chimmo and
spoke in a low voice, and then they both<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
laughed wildly. Indeed, the subaltern beat
upon the table as though he would suffocate.</p>

<p>I remember again, one afternoon, that I
was sent with a tray of seltzer and glasses to
the poop. The commander of the ship was
seated in company with the doctor and the
two military men. An awning was stretched
overhead, and its shadow was pleasant with
the breath of a small breeze off the beam, and
it danced with a strange pulsing of lights from
the diamond twinkling of the brilliant blue sea.</p>

<p>We had by this time crossed the Equator;
I believe our latitude was about three degrees
south. Sentries paced the fore part of the
poop as usual; the sentry forward sheltered
himself in the gloom of the corner of sail;
a few convicts were lounging in a lifeless
manner betwixt the barricades. Tom was
one of the convicts. He sat at the foot of the
mainmast in the shadow of it with his elbows
on his knees, his brows betwixt his clenched
fists, his head hanging down, his eyes rooted
to the deck, his whole posture extraordinary
with its suggestion of that sort of grief which
turns a man into stone.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>Captain Sutherland and the others sat
near the foremost skylight that stood but a
short distance from the break of the poop.
The captain told me to put the tray down on
the skylight and fetch a bottle of brandy. I
returned with the brandy and a corkscrew,
when, just as I was about to draw the cork,
the doctor lifted his hand, and with an odd
pleased look, bade me stand still and make no
noise. Then it was that I heard a sound of
singing; the melody was a hymn, but I
cannot give it a name; I have since believed
it was the air of a well-known hymn sung to
words which were written by some convict
converted into an honest man by the doctor
during a previous voyage.</p>

<p>I judged by the volume of sound that
about ten men sang; they sat under the hatch
where the gratings made a frame like a bird-cage,
otherwise we should not have heard
them. They sang well, in good time, and one
deep voice was noticeable for its manner of
working into the singing in a harmonising
way as though the fellow knew music.</p>

<p>Captain Barrett asked a question.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>&#8216;Hush, I beg of you,&#8217; said the doctor,
with a face of grave satisfaction.</p>

<p>No one could have listened to the voice of
the finest Italian opera-singer of the day with
more relish and ardent attention than the
doctor to the chanting of the convicts.</p>

<p>The singing ceased. I stood at a little
distance, with the brandy and the corkscrew,
waiting to be told to draw the cork.</p>

<p>&#8216;Whose was that deep voice?&#8217; said Captain
Barrett.</p>

<p>&#8216;Barney Abram&#8217;s,&#8217; answered the doctor.</p>

<p>&#8216;Was it a Christian hymn they sang?&#8217;
asked Captain Barrett.</p>

<p>&#8216;Certainly,&#8217; responded the doctor. &#8216;Do
you suppose that I would allow any other
sort of hymn to be sung in this ship?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What&#8217;s Barney&#8217;s creed?&#8217; said the subaltern.</p>

<p>&#8216;He&#8217;s coming right,&#8217; answered the doctor,
severely. And then turning to Captain Sutherland,
he exclaimed: &#8216;I know you take an
interest in these matters. You will be gratified
to learn that Abram expressed a wish
yesterday to be received into our Church.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>&#8216;Indeed!&#8217; said Captain Sutherland.</p>

<p>&#8216;That could only be done by a bishop or
a clergyman, I suppose?&#8217; said the subaltern.</p>

<p>The doctor, without answering, left the
poop, walked to the main-hatch and addressed
some words to the men at the bottom of it.</p>

<p>&#8216;What&#8217;s your opinion of Barney&#8217;s conversion?&#8217;
said Captain Sutherland to Captain
Barrett.</p>

<p>&#8216;My opinion is,&#8217; answered the other, &#8216;that
I shall give instructions for the sentries to
keep an extra sharp eye upon him.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Now the hymn&#8217;s over, suppose we get
that cork drawn?&#8217; said the subaltern.</p>

<p>I started on the captain of the ship turning
to look at me. My eyes had been fastened
upon Tom, who, on the doctor approaching
the hatchway, had risen and gone to the rail,
and stood there looking out to sea. The
convicts came up in divisions to breathe the
air. It was so burning hot that the doctor
had stopped the walking exercise. Tom&#8217;s
division happened to be up, and my eyes were
rooted to his pale face as he stood looking
over the rail into the dim blue distance, when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span>
I was startled by Captain Sutherland turning
upon me.</p>

<p>&#8216;Draw that cork,&#8217; said he; &#8216;I had forgotten
you.&#8217; And he said to Lieutenant
Chimmo, but he did not mean that I should
hear him: &#8216;Do you observe that this lad is
always at one&#8217;s elbow when the convicts are
under discussion?&#8217;</p>

<p>This speech brought some colour into my
face; I was sensible that I blushed and was
deeply vexed that I did so. All three watched
me draw the cork out of the brandy bottle. I
poured brandy into the tumblers and filled
them up with foaming seltzer and handed the
draughts to the gentlemen. Captain Barrett
looked me hard in the face when I handed
him his tumbler. My fears made me find
detection in his stare; I thought to myself in
his heart this man has found out that I am a
woman.</p>

<p>I went toward the companion hatch to
re-enter the cuddy; Lieutenant Chimmo said
loudly, as though indifferent whether I heard
or not: &#8216;What a devilish good-looking chap
he is! He blushes like a girl.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>&#8216;There&#8217;s a mystery about the youngster,&#8217;
said Captain Barrett. &#8216;He puzzles me.&#8217;</p>

<p>I did not catch what the captain let fall,
but feeling alarmed and eager to know if
more was said, I ran hastily down the companion
steps and posted myself under the
open foremost skylight.</p>

<p>&#8216;What makes you think so?&#8217; I heard
Lieutenant Chimmo say.</p>

<p>&#8216;He seems too stoutly built for a lad,&#8217;
answered Captain Barrett.</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8217;ve met young fellows more girlish-looking
than that lad,&#8217; exclaimed Captain
Sutherland. &#8216;The apprentice, Johnstone, I
understand, knows all about him. Johnstone
is of respectable stock. His father is a solicitor
near the Tower; I&#8217;ve never done business
with him, but he has helped many a poor
gentleman of the jacket out of difficulties.&#8217;</p>

<p>The subaltern spoke of several effeminate
officers whom he had met with in various
places. He mentioned one Captain Dawson,
who, he said, was called Pretty Polly. He
wore his hair parted down the middle; it was
a rich auburn and waved, and the fellows of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
his regiment tried to persuade him to let it
grow to see to what length it would descend.
He had no hair except eyebrows and eyelashes
upon his face; his complexion was
amazingly delicate, much more so than young
Marlowe&#8217;s. He blushed readily; his voice
was a contralto, and when he sang you
thought you were listening to a woman.</p>

<p>This reminded Captain Barrett of a girlish-looking
cornet named Sheridan. Then Captain
Sutherland furnished an instance of a
singularly effeminate second mate; after which,
amid frequent sippings of brandy and seltzer
and puffing of paper cigars, the conversation
went again to Barney Abram, thence to other
matters; whereupon, satisfied that they had
done with the topic of girlish-looking boys, I
went to the pantry, breathing a little more
freely, though still somewhat uneasy, for I was
afraid of the meaning I had found in the stare
that Captain Barrett had regarded me with.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXX<br />


<small>SHE CONVERSES WITH HER SWEETHEART</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> utmost I dared hope was that my sex
would remain concealed until we had rounded
the Cape of Good Hope. When once our
ship had entered the great Southern Ocean,
there would be no more land to touch at
until Hobart Town was reached. Often at
home, whilst thinking of Tom and resolving
to follow him, had I studied the map of the
world&mdash;or rather those portions of the globe
which a ship traversed in her passage from
the Thames to Tasmania; and I knew that
there was no land betwixt Agulhas and the
great New-Holland continent, saving two little
islands, one called St. Paul&#8217;s and the other
Amsterdam Island, the latter of which it was
then customary (I had read or been told) for
ships to sight to verify their reckonings. But
it was a desert island, not such an island as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
the doctor would set me ashore on; so that
after we should round the Cape I had no fear
of being landed; nor was it very conceivable
that the doctor, however suspicious he might
prove, would think it needful to tranship me
should an opportunity occur, seeing that our
destination would not then be very remote,
with the proper machinery for inquiry at
hand there should the doctor or Captain
Sutherland think proper to charge me.</p>

<p>I was relieved, however, by finding that,
during the remainder of that day, Captain
Barrett took no further notice of me. The
heat was very great. The doctor said it was
like a furnace in the &#8217;tweendecks, and that
some of the convicts who were sick in the
hospital were suffering fearfully. The heels
of three or four wind-sails penetrated the
hatches, but the air blew small and fiery hot,
and the gushing of it down those canvas
pipes made no sensible difference in the fever
of the atmosphere of the &#8217;tweendecks, filled
with the breath and the heat of the bodies of
the two hundred and thirty convicts.</p>

<p>At dinner in the cuddy, on the afternoon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
of the third day, dating from the incident of
the singing of the hymn in the hatch, the
captain spoke of a partial eclipse of the moon
that was to happen that evening at about
nine o&#8217;clock. I stood behind the captain&#8217;s
chair when this was said, for I must tell you
that I now regularly waited at table, though
Frank was above me, and I had to do work
which Mr. Stiles would not have put the
young German to.</p>

<p>The doctor lifted his head from the soup-plate
which he overhung and exclaimed: &#8216;A
partial eclipse of the moon? That will be an
interesting sight!&#8217;</p>

<p>Captain Barrett and the subaltern asked
several questions about this eclipse. The
conversation flowed on. I fetched a second
or third course from the galley, and whilst
the captain carved, the doctor, looking at him,
said: &#8216;I have a great mind to allow the
convicts, in divisions, to witness this eclipse.
The spectacle might produce a very salutary
effect upon the minds of many. The loneliness
of the ocean, the sight of the familiar
face of the moon being slowly darkened&mdash;it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
will provide me with a fine subject for our
address to-morrow, and the prisoners will be
more likely to benefit from my discourse by
having beheld the eclipse. You are sure, sir,
that the hour is nine?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;About nine. I will presently let you
know for certain,&#8217; answered the captain.</p>

<p>&#8216;We should require the guard drawn up
on the poop,&#8217; said the doctor.</p>

<p>&#8216;Give your orders, Ellice,&#8217; said Captain
Barrett.</p>

<p>&#8216;The soldiers and the women will enjoy
the sight,&#8217; said the doctor; &#8216;it is insufferably
hot in the prison. These occasional indulgences
often do much good.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;How long does the eclipse last?&#8217; asked
the subaltern.</p>

<p>&#8216;I believe the disk is less than a quarter
obscured,&#8217; replied the captain.</p>

<p>&#8216;That should give time for each division
to take a peep,&#8217; exclaimed Captain Barrett.</p>

<p>Here I was sent into the pantry, and lost
what followed. I gathered, however, on my
return, from what the doctor and the others
let fall, that the matter was settled, and that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>
the convicts in divisions, the guard being
under arms on the poop, were to be brought
up on deck to view the partial eclipse of the
moon.</p>

<p>Dinner was over in the cuddy by seven.
The captain and military officers went on to
the poop to smoke, and I carried coffee to
them whilst Frank waited upon Mr. Bates
and his brother mate. The doctor, who did
not smoke, and who drank his wine well
watered, descended the booby-hatch to acquaint
the prisoners with his intentions, and
to make the necessary arrangements. It was
a true tropic night, splendid and silent.
Often do I recall that night, and always with
a bitter sense of the blindness of the human
mind, of our incapacity to see one minute
ahead of us. The moon at this hour was
rising, and the lunar dawn lay in a streak of
dim red along the eastern seaboard. I do
not remember the hour; it was not yet eight
bells; in the west was a fast-waning flush,
for we floated in a part of the ocean where
the night crosses the sea in a stride. Not a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
breath of air! The waters stretched flat as a
surface of polished ebony, and only at intervals
there ran a sighing sort of movement
over the sea, which sent a delicate stir
through the canvas, and set the dew raining
from aloft in little pattering showers. In the
south there was much lightning; the leap of
the violet sparks flashed up the battlements
and ragged brows of a mass of electric cloud.
The water reflected the play, and sometimes
a little note of distant thunder came humming
across the glass-smooth surface. Elsewhere
under the brightest of the stars hung tremulous
wakes of silver fire.</p>

<p>Even now, early as it was, the mighty
shadow of the ocean night was majestic and
awful with the wild, flashful colouring of
lightning in the south, and the dustlike multitude
of stars over the three glooming spires
of our ship, and the rising moon rusty-red
and imperfect and distorted, as though lifting
heavily through some noxious belt of African
river vapour.</p>

<p>What I saw, however, was quickly embraced
by my sight. Having put the gentlemen&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
coffee upon the skylight, I durst not
linger.</p>

<p>The steward found me plenty to do till
a quarter before nine. I then went to my
cabin to refresh myself with a wash. When
I came into the cuddy again, I found the
lamps turned down and heard a sound of
many feet in motion. I stepped into the
recess and found nobody there. I walked a
little way forward along the gangway alley,
and looking up at the poop, saw the guard
drawn in a line near the rail. The awning
was furled, and the moonlight sparkled on
their firearms, and the bayonets glanced as
the lightning leapt in the south.</p>

<p>A division of convicts was in the inclosure,
standing in dusky groups, and at
every man&#8217;s feet stretched his shadow, with
scarcely a move of the clean black line of
it, so reposefully did the ship sleep. I saw
a crowd of seamen on the forecastle and
heard women&#8217;s voices, and guessed that the
wives had gone forward to view the eclipse.</p>

<p>The moon was now bright. You could
distinguish faces by her beam. I went<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
slowly along the gangway alley, looking hard
at the prisoners, and when about midway I
saw a man standing alone, with his arms
folded and his eyes fixed on the moon. It
was Tom. I stopped. I must tell you that
this fore-and-aft barricade, which was designed
as a convenience more than as a prison
barrier, was not above five feet high, and
formed of strong wooden rails, sufficiently
wide apart to disclose the figure. I coughed,
and then Tom saw me.</p>

<p>I advanced very slowly in the direction of
the forecastle and then came to a stand and
seemed to look at the moon; and when I
warily turned my eyes upon the inclosure I
observed that Tom had advanced as I had
and was abreast of me, though he had drawn
nearer to the fore-and-aft barricade. My
heart beat quickly, for if I could speak to
him now it would be the first time since
that day when I had whispered as I passed
and when he had discovered that I was on
board.</p>

<p>I walked a little way farther. This carried
me out of sight of the poop, unless any<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
one should come to the head of the port
poop-ladder and stare along the alley. The
yards were braced forward, and the corner
of the foresail lay between me and the moon,
and plunged in shadow that part of the deck
where I again halted. I saw that Tom had
walked with me on the other side of the
barricade, and when I stopped he stopped,
too, so close that had he sighed I should
have heard him. The shadow that was upon
me was upon him and stretched athwart the
deck, darkening the two galleys and the
great mass of long-boat; but under the yawn
of the foresail the forecastle whitened out in
the light, with the silvered figures of many
persons upon it, and beyond hung the jibs,
falling like streaks of snow to the bowsprit
and jibbooms. Outside the shadow in the
inclosure the moonshine lay like frost upon
the planks, and the shapes of the convicts,
in their pale apparel, showed like figures in
yellow wood. They moved or stood in
groups; here and there was a lonely shape.
The nearest group to where I had come to
a stand was at a distance of about twenty<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
paces, close against the fore-and-aft barricade.
The yet distant lightning flashed
upon the canvas, and high as the royals
which crowned the towering fabric of cloths
the sails flashed and faded in the electric play
as though to the revolution of some gigantic
violet-tinted lantern.</p>

<p>I kept my back upon Tom and seemed
to be looking up at the sky; he stood with
his right side toward me gazing aft as though
he heeded me not. We spoke swiftly under
our breath.</p>

<p>&#8216;How is it with you, Tom?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;This coolness and freshness and moonlight&mdash;it
is heaven after the hell below. My
brave heart, my beloved girl, how is it with
you?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Well; I am happy. I am with you.
Our time is coming. In our new home all
this will be no more than a horrid dream.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;A dream!&#8217; said he, with fierceness in
his whisper. &#8216;It is no dream to be ruined
and have one&#8217;s heart broken. They have
made a devil of me. I am no longer fit for
you. You don&#8217;t know my heart.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>&#8216;Whatever you are, I am. If they have
made you a devil I will be a devil too. I am
yours and one with you, and live for nothing
but for you. Ask me to set this ship on fire
to-night and I&#8217;ll do it.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Ay, yours is the true woman&#8217;s spirit.
I have no right to such a love. It is too
noble for a wretch. Don&#8217;t let them ruin
two lives. Curse them! See what they
have made of me! I would to God you
were not here.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, Tom!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Ay, but to see you dragging the dirty
burthen of the cuddy along the deck&mdash;to
think of my proud and beautiful girl masquerading
as a boy&mdash;ordered about by
wretches who would be glad to clean her
doorsteps and windows at home&mdash;and for a
convict! But you know I am innocent.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Whisper softly,&#8217; said I, marking a note
of bitter temper, a tone as of ferocity in his
speech. It hissed in his feverishly rapid
whispers and seemed as a revelation to me
of a change of nature. &#8216;Do not gesticulate;
the sentry at the head of the poop-ladder<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>
seems to be watching us. I have settled it
thus: On our arrival I will take steps to
qualify as a landholder, and you shall come
to me. Leave me to act and keep up your
heart, and do not say you wish I was not
here.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;This ship will never arrive!&#8217; said he.</p>

<p>&#8216;Why do you say that?&#8217; I whispered,
turning to look at him and then giving him
my back again.</p>

<p>&#8216;That&#8217;s what I mean by wishing to God
you were not here,&#8217; he answered, whispering
passionately, as though he could not contain
himself. &#8216;This ship will never arrive! I
could save her and I could save life by a
word. If I thought you were in danger&mdash;but
not with me! Not with me! Abram
and others have taken their oaths upon it,
and they cannot do without me. They don&#8217;t
know that you are a girl. They must not
know it! You are my dear friend and that
is enough; and they believe you to be
friendly toward them and would help them
if you could. They&#8217;ll not harm you. I&#8217;d
strangle myself sooner than utter a word<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
that should save this ship! I&#8217;m here for a
crime I never committed. They have made
a devil of me! I&#8217;ll take no active part. I&#8217;ll
have no blood upon my head, but I&#8217;ll help
them in the way they want when they call
upon me.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What can I do?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Nothing but wait.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8217;d give my life to free you!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Oh, your devotion breaks my heart! I
was worthy of it once.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;When is this thing to happen?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;The ship will be in the hands of the
convicts to-morrow.&#8217;</p>

<p>I fetched a deep breath and turned cold.</p>

<p>&#8216;And Will&mdash;and Will, Tom?&#8217; I said in a
whisper that shuddered with the icy fit.</p>

<p>&#8216;I have stipulated for Will. They&#8217;ll not
hurt him.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;How will they be able to do it?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Some of the crew are with them. For
three weeks this has been secretly working
out. I&#8217;m the only navigator among the convicts,
and they depend on me.&#8217; He added,
after a pause, during which my breath came<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
and went hysterically: &#8216;If you fear for yourself
or for Will; if you think this thing
should not be done&mdash;for it will be attempted,
and if it is attempted it will be done&mdash;go to
the captain of the ship, tell him that the
convicts, backed by a portion of his crew,
have planned to seize the vessel, and that
to save her the sentries must be doubled
throughout, no convicts allowed on deck,
no messmen to pass the main-hatch sentry,
the prison victuals to be passed through the
door of the steerage bulkhead by the soldiers,
mates, and trustworthy petty officers of the
ship.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Why should I tell him this?&#8217;</p>

<p>He was silent.</p>

<p>&#8216;Sooner than speak, I would fling myself
into the sea.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;It will be a bloody business.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;But if it gives you your liberty!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;They have driven me to it!&#8217; he cried,
raising his voice; and he stamped on the
deck in the passion of the minute.</p>

<p>&#8216;Gangway there!&#8217; shouted the forecastle<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span>
sentry. &#8216;What are you doing at that barricade?
Come out of it!&#8217;</p>

<p>I instantly walked forward, and whilst I
walked I heard the voice of the doctor on
the poop.</p>

<p>&#8216;Let the people fall in. Let the captains
rank them on the starboard side, where
they&#8217;ll get a good view.&#8217;</p>

<p>I went up the forecastle ladder, at the
head of which stood the sentry. He was the
husband of the pretty young woman&mdash;the
Dick who had been on duty when I visited
the barracks.</p>

<p>&#8216;Is it you?&#8217; said he. &#8216;You mustn&#8217;t get
yarning with the convicts. It&#8217;s against the
orders.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yarning!&#8217; said I. &#8216;If a prisoner wishes
me good-night and asks me questions about
the moon, I may stop to be civil, I hope?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;It&#8217;s against the orders,&#8217; said he, and with
a swing of his figure he resumed his walk.</p>

<p>The greater part of the crowd on the
forecastle stood in the bows or head of the
ship. The whole of the crew was assembled;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span>
the soldiers&#8217; wives, some of them holding
children by the hands, swelled the crowd.
I stepped to a part of the forecastle rail
where the deck was vacant and looked out
to sea. The hush on the ocean this side
the storm was unutterably deep, and the
distant tempest did not vex it, though the
great masses of vapour had risen considerably
and the lightning was running all over the
breast of it in rills of fire, and the thunder
boomed along the level plain of sea as though
some leviathan mermen or Titans of the brine
were playing at bowls upon the horizon.</p>

<p>I looked up at the moon and beheld the
shadow of the earth touching the crystal
edge of the satellite like a ring of smoke.
The reflection flowed gloriously under the
luminary in a spreading wake of greenish
silver, whose hither extremity trembled to
the vessel&#8217;s side. The convict ship, sleeping
upon the dark and breathless surface of
water, her white sails gently fanning at long
intervals to a delicate motion of the hull;
the dark figures of the convicts grouped in
a mass on one side of the main-deck, their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span>
faces pale in the night-beam as they gazed
at the moon; the crowd of seamen and women
talking in subdued voices in the bows of the
ship, where beyond them soared the jibs
floating like gossamer in the moonlight; the
dark ocean stretching, stirless and silent,
into the north, star-studded, whilst southward
it was lighted up by the distant, sunbright
and violet flames of the electric clouds; the
face of the patient, silver moon, with a shadow
of the earth painted in a corner of her&mdash;this
was a scene so rich in poetry, so vital, besides,
with a strange, bitter human significance,
that at any other time I would have
abandoned my whole spirit to it and lost
myself in contemplation.</p>

<p>But I could think of nothing but my conversation
with Tom, the change my quick ear
had detected in his nature, his assurance to
me that I did not know his heart&mdash;above all,
his statement that before to-morrow night
the ship would be in possession of the convicts.
I believed him, but I could not realise
his meaning. Yet I remember very well that
conversation I had overheard between two<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
sailors who talked of the convicts, knowing
that Tom&mdash;I guessed they meant Tom&mdash;was
the only navigator among the prisoners.</p>

<p>I tried to settle my spirits, but my heart
flung a fever into my blood and I longed to
laugh out, to cry out, to run about. As the
shadow deepened upon the moon, the crowd
upon the forecastle fell silent. I looked over
the side into the dark water and beheld a
fish-shaped phantom of phosphorus sliding
slowly along close under the surface; there
was a little bubbling of fire about the centre
of this strange shape where the fin of it projected.
I knew what it was, yet glanced
once or twice only without curiosity and
went on thinking.</p>

<p>Would they spare my cousin Will?
Would they spare me? How could Tom
be sure? The liberation of the convicts
would be like the disgorging of hell. How
could Tom foretell what would follow the
demons&#8217; seizure of the ship? But I cared
not. Let Tom but gain his liberty and
it mattered nothing to me what followed,
though my own life should be forfeited. By<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
the magic of sympathy the change that I had
noticed in him was working in me. I felt as
though a devil had entered into me, even as
Tom had whispered that they had driven him
to it: that injustice and labour and punishment,
maddening to an innocent heart, had
made a devil of him.</p>

<p>I was in the way of the walk of the
forecastle sentry; that is to say, at the extremity
of it, and twice he halted at my
side to look at the moon, but never spoke.
I heard the doctor talking to the prisoners.
He addressed them from over the rail of
the poop, and no doubt made the most of
this solemn occasion of eclipse and the terror
of the gathering storm and the mighty scene
of loneliness in whose heart the ship slumbered.</p>

<p>I was forced to the quarter-deck presently
by a ridiculous argument between the
boatswain and the cook. The cook declared
that it had long ago been proved that the
earth was flat; therefore, as that corner of
shadow upon the moon was round, it could
not be cast by the earth. Mr. Balls, with a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span>
loud, hoarse laugh, exclaimed that those who
believed the earth to be flat were misled by
the shape of their own heads.</p>

<p>&#8216;Not that I&#8217;m a-going to argue,&#8217; said he,
&#8216;that that there shadder&#8217;s the earth&#8217;s. For
the matter of that, who&#8217;s going to say it&#8217;s a
shadder at all? The moon has a hatmosphere,
I suppose, and why shouldn&#8217;t its
hatmosphere be shaped as our&#8217;n is with
mucky thicknesses like to what&#8217;s blazing
away yonder? Who&#8217;s a-going to prove to
me that that there shadder, instead of an
eclipse, as they calls it, ain&#8217;t a storrum?&#8217;</p>

<p>I walked aft and sat upon the coamings
of the booby-hatch where I was alone. A
fresh division of convicts had been brought
up, and the doctor stood over my head
haranguing them. He spoke of the enormity
of the crimes they had committed, and begged
them to consider the moon as a likeness of
their soul and the shadow overcreeping it as
the darkness of sin and death. &#8216;But presently,&#8217;
said he, &#8216;that shadow will pass, and
the brightness of the moon will look forth
in splendour, and the sea beneath it will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span>
smile and rejoice in her light. Be it even
so with you, my brother sinners; pray that
the shadow that is upon you may pass away,
that the light which is within you may purely
shine again.&#8217;</p>

<small>SHE DESCRIBES A STORM</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> now the storm was approaching, the
moon&#8217;s light was growing weak and the stars
over our mastheads dim and spare. The
lightning was incessant; its flashes glanced
into the remotest recesses of the north and
brought out the horizon there in gleams of
sulphur. The hum of the thunder was deep
and ceaseless, with many savage cracks and
rattling peals. I cannot tell what progress
the eclipse had made by this hour; the moon
hung distorted in the sky like a dim silver
shield with its sides hacked, and the night
looked wild with her and the gathering
tempest.</p>

<p>I heard the commander of the ship address
the doctor, who called to the captains
of the division to march the prisoners below;
and he added that the last of the divisions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
could not be brought up, as sail was to be
reduced and room was wanted. Moreover, in
a very short time the moon would have
vanished. Now followed a lively time. The
prisoners&#8217; inclosure being clear, Mr. Bates, at
the head of the poop-ladder, began to shout out
orders; all hands were on deck and all hands
were wanted. &#8216;Clew up the royals and furl
them! Down flying and outer jibs and topgallant
staysails! Clew up topgallant sails
and furl them! Main-clewgarnets and let the
sail hang!&#8217; So ran the orders; the lightning
played upon the figures of the seamen as they
trotted aloft; the moon turned a watery,
silvery, oozing, draining through the film of
the advanced shadow of the storm, then
vanished behind a jagged peak of cloud, and
the night-dye sank upon the ocean in deepest
shadow, the deeper for the play of the lightning;
after each flash the blackness thrilled
with the blindness of the vision.</p>

<p>The women came off the forecastle, and I
entered the cuddy. The steward told me to
turn up the lights, and Captain Barrett and
Lieutenant Chimmo, descending the companion-steps<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>
at that moment, called for brandy
and seltzer, which I procured for them. The
steward bade me be at hand; if there was a
gale of wind in the storm, I, with the rest of
the &#8216;idlers,&#8217; would be wanted. I hung about
in the recess, and all the time I wondered
whether the convicts would rise in the morning,
whether their friends amongst the crew
were to be depended upon; whether this
storm of thunder and lightning would work a
change in the prisoners&#8217; intentions by terrifying
them; and I also strove to imagine the
programme that had been concerted, what
part the confederate seamen were to play;
whether the guard would find time to arm
and turn out, and if so, whether the uprising
would not be suppressed by their coolness
and discipline and by the support of the loyal
part of the crew.</p>

<p>The storm was now overhead; the ship
was clothed in lightning and the thunder was
deafening and frightful. The whole fabric
trembled to every explosion as though the
broadside of a three-decker had been fired
into her. There was no wind. The men had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span>
come from aloft, and the ship stood motionless
and upright under her three topsails, the
courses hanging festooned in their gear. I
crouched in a corner of the recess, amazed
and bewildered. I had always from a child
been frightened of lightning, and here now
was lightning that was like one vast sheet of
flame; the heavens were sheeted with its
blinding blaze; it was so continuous that you
saw the ship as by sunshine; the whole vessel
crackled with sparks and explosions, fireballs
ran down the chain-topsail sheets, played
about the pumps, sparkled and snapped on
the boom-irons at the yardarms, and the sea
that had been silent roared back in echo to
the thunder and spread out in a wide field of
blue light that came and went, sometimes
showing in a leap of light that was as the flash
that it mirrored, then blackening for a breath
or two, during which you saw nothing but
the fireballs running over the ship.</p>

<p>It rained and hailed suddenly with incredible
fury. The decks smoked; by the
lightning flashes you saw the spray of the
cataractal fall rising like steam to above the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span>
height of a man. Just then the ship was
struck; I heard a crash and splintering on
high, and a great bulb of blue fire fell down
the rigging over the side into the sea, where
it burst like an exploded cannon. The mate
overhead shouted, and the boatswain who was
forward bawled in answer.</p>

<p>Captain Barrett and the subaltern stood
at the cabin table; they had emptied their
tumblers and put down their cigars, and
looked pale and glanced often up at the
skylight, into which the lightning streamed in
an almost continuous living dazzle. I hung
in the cuddy door for shelter from the smoking
wet; a head showed in the booby-hatch and
cried out: &#8216;The doctor wants some brandy;
bring down half a tumblerful at once.&#8217; I
ran to the table, took a glass from a swing
tray, and half filled it with brandy. The
steward at that moment coming up through
the steerage-hatch called to me: &#8216;Hi, you
there! What are you about? Liquoring
up unbeknown instead of being at your
prayers?&#8217;</p>

<p>Lieutenant Chimmo grinned dismally.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span>&#8216;The doctor&#8217;s in the barracks and wants
brandy,&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;Curse it, what&#8217;s wrong?&#8217; exclaimed Captain
Barrett, and instantly ran to the booby-hatch,
followed by the subaltern.</p>

<p>&#8216;Get on, then, get on!&#8217; shouted Mr. Stiles,
who had been drinking.</p>

<p>I ran with the brandy to the hatch, and
seeing nobody to hand it to, descended. The
scene of this interior of bulkheaded steerage
was extraordinary; a lantern burnt dimly, its
light was paled by the electric fires, which
sparkled all over the prison bulkhead as though
the wood was alive with the phosphoric lights
of decay and rot. The bulkhead was studded
with mushroom-headed nails, and every nail
was tipped with fire. The sight was fearful;
I thought the ship was burning. The women
and the children were gathered in a heap in
one corner, holding to one another, as though
the vessel was about to founder; no child
cried; the roar of the thunder seemed to have
frightened the infants into silence.</p>

<p>A man lay on his back against the prison
door, which was a little way open; the doctor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span>
bent over him and Captain Barrett and the
subaltern stood close looking down. Such of
the guard as were below were grouped with
the women and children; they seemed dazed.
The prostrate man was a soldier; doubtless
the sentry stationed at the prison door. His
musket, with its fixed bayonet, lay at a little
distance from him, and I saw threads of fire
writhing upon the bayonet.</p>

<p>&#8216;Here&#8217;s the brandy!&#8217; cried Captain Barrett.</p>

<p>The doctor looked up, and extended his
hand for the glass. This brought me close to
the door, and for a minute or two I had a
clear view of the &#8217;tweendecks prison. The
cage-like barricade at the main-hatch was full
of great nails, and every nail glowed as though
red-hot. I don&#8217;t know where the lightning
found entrance. It flashed through the blackness
of this floating dungeon as if half a dozen
hatches lay open to the sky. Wherever there
was iron for the electric fires to catch hold of
a small blue brilliant blaze was burning, inexpressibly
wild and awful to behold. I clearly
saw the whole sweep of the deck&mdash;the tiers
of sleeping shelves stretching on either hand,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span>
the tables, the bulkhead of the prison and
whatever else there was of grim and odious
furniture in that interior. Numbers of the
convicts lay motionless upon their faces on
the deck; many crouched in squatting postures,
with their hands to their heads; a few
stood erect, defiant, as though waiting and
heedless of what was next to happen. One of
these, I might be sure, was Tom.</p>

<p>No imagination could feign the terror
which the figures of the prostrate and crouching
convicts expressed. You needed to witness
the scene, as I did, by the terrific lights
that illuminated the prison and by the ceaseless
glittering of the lightning streaming
through the interior in shocks and explosions
of dazzling light. And the roar of the
thunder heard in this resonant cavity was
more dreadful to listen to than the stupendous
voice of it on deck, whilst a deep and ceaseless
note was added to the detonations by the
Niagara-like fall of hail and rain upon the
echoing planks.</p>

<p>&#8216;Is he dead, doctor?&#8217; asked Captain
Barrett.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>&#8216;No,&#8217; said the doctor. &#8216;Have this door
shut, sir, and let another sentry be posted.
You can leave the brandy and go,&#8217; said he to
me; on which I returned to the cuddy and
stood as before near the doorway.</p>

<p>I believe this terrible storm had reached
the height of its rage when the ship was
struck. Its fury was now waning, though the
soot in the north continued to vomit sheets
of flame and the thunder-shocks striking the
level of the breathless sea were as the noise
of the rending of mountains. I have heard
of but one such another storm in which a
convict ship bore part. The vessel was the
<i>Earl Grey</i>, with two hundred and sixty-four
prisoners on board. The year was, I believe,
1842, and the ship was bound, as the <i>Childe
Harold</i> was, to Van Diemen&#8217;s Land. Dr.
Browning, who was the surgeon-superintendent,
mentions the storm in his account of the
voyage, but he saw nothing of it, owing to his
suffering from an affection of the heart which
obliged him to keep his cabin. This I regret,
as I should have been glad to know how the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span>
prisoners under his charge behaved on that
occasion.</p>

<p>It was now about a quarter to eleven; the
rain had ceased, but the decks were full of
water, which cascaded continuously into the
calm sea through the scupper-holes. The
captain and his mates kept the poop. I heard
the squelch of their tread as they tramped to
and fro in their sodden boots. Suddenly an
order was shouted, and in a few minutes two
or three men came aft, one of them holding
a lantern. They gathered about the pump
and the second mate left the poop and joined
them. I could not see what they did, but
after a short interval the second mate went
on the poop again, and the men, one of them
swinging the lantern, walked forward.</p>

<p>A little clock hung under the break of
the poop in the cuddy recess hard by the
soldiers&#8217; arms; a bull&#8217;s-eye lamp cast a light
upon its face; this lamp was used for heaving
the log, for writing up the log-slate and the
like, and the clock for keeping the ship&#8217;s
bells. A figure came off the poop to see the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span>
time; he was draped in streaming oilskins,
which flashed out to the lightning, but his
face was so muffled by his sou&#8217;-wester, that I
looked two or three times before I knew him
to be Will. I was still alone in the cuddy;
Frank and the steward were probably in the
steerage; I took a step or two that carried
me to the door and pronounced Will&#8217;s name.</p>

<p>He drew close and said: &#8216;What do you
think of this?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;It is awful,&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>&#8216;It might have been worse than awful!&#8217;
he exclaimed. &#8216;The ship has been struck!
Luckily, the thunderbolt went overboard.
Had it gone through the bottom we should
have followed it; nothing could have saved
us. But it&#8217;s all right with the old hooker;
the well&#8217;s just been sounded again and she&#8217;s
as dry as a rotten nut.&#8217;</p>

<p>I looked at him eagerly; my heart all at
once grew so full, that I felt I must speak or
shriek out; I set my teeth on my lip and bit
till I tasted blood, and clenched my hands
till my arms stiffened as though I had been
poisoned, whilst I turned my head that he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span>
might not see me. He said: &#8216;I must be off.
Why don&#8217;t you go to bed? There&#8217;s nothing
to keep you up. A fine night&#8217;ll be coming
along by eight bells and they&#8217;ll be making
sail.&#8217; With that he went up the ladder.</p>

<p>I had barely arrested speech in myself:
but for that supreme effort I should have
warned him, and he would at once have
carried the news to the captain.</p>

<p>I stood in the door, gazing at the ship
that flashed out and vanished, no longer
scared by the flames and the thunder. I
could think of nothing but what to-morrow
was to bring forth. Men in scores lay below
in the prison quarter, stricken into motionless
logs by fright. Were they and the like
of them capable of a victorious uprising?
And suppose the ship seized, what was to
follow? I dared not think how the convicts
might serve those who were not of them. I
asked myself: If they put Tom in charge of
the ship, what will he do with her, and how
will he act so as to escape from the ruffians
and secure his own liberty? Then I thought
to myself: he is an innocent man now, though<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span>
suffering as a criminal; but if the ship is
seized by the convicts, he&#8217;ll be taken as
having helped them, as being one of the two
hundred and thirty, as being the one who
navigated the ship afterwards, and who was
as answerable as any of the rest for all that
happened. He will then be a criminal in
terrible earnest. Indeed, the business might
bring him to the gallows. But then, thought
I, he is a convict now in any case. He cannot
be worse off. He never can&mdash;he never would&mdash;return
home. Whatever happens cannot
blacken his future. The darkness over which
that lightning is flashing is not deeper. If
the convicts rise, he may escape and get his
liberty, free himself from his felon clothes,
and hide with a changed name in a foreign
country. Oh, cried my heart, God grant that
I may be spared to escape with him wherever
he goes!</p>

<p>Thus ran my thoughts. After all these
years, I put them dully and coldly; but they
boiled in me then. They were as the electric
fluid itself whilst I stood in the doorway of
that cuddy, mechanically watching the great<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>
fabric of the ship glancing out green and
violet and yellow to the lights of the storm
over the bow.</p>

<p>Shortly after eleven the sky cleared in the
south; the clouds rolled away in black masses
into the north, and the moon shone out, and
the sea was again beautiful with her light.
A soft wind blew and the decks grew busy
with the life of seamen&#8217;s figures running here
and there, and pulling and dragging and
making sail to the noise of hoarse cries and
choruses. The steward lurched up to me,
and his breath filled the atmosphere around
with a smell of spirits. He said, with a
hiccough: &#8216;You can turn in.&#8217; So I went
below and lay down, fully clothed, in my
bunk, but not to sleep.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXXII<br />


<small>SHE DESCRIBES THE SEIZURE OF THE SHIP BY
THE CONVICTS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">My</span> head was full of Tom, of that change
into fierceness which I had noticed in his
whispers, and I dwelt upon his sad, wild
saying that I did not know his heart, by
which he meant that his heart had been
transformed by the wrong that had been
done him and by his punishment and sufferings.
Never had I felt madder than when I
thought of him. I put my hands together,
and prayed that if the convicts rose they
would successfully seize the ship.</p>

<p>My blood was so hot and the heat of the
atmosphere so great that I could not rest. I
opened the porthole and put my face into it
for the coolness of the air, and for a long
while listened to the pleasant, rippling sounds
of the water gently broken, and to the gushing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span>
of water from the decks and the noise
of men&#8217;s voices high aloft, and sounding as
though the tones came across the sea. The
moon was on the other side, but the stars
were again plentiful, many meteors sailed in
delicate trails of light, and the sea-line ran
black against the sheet lightning that played
behind it. The dew-laden night-breath fanned
my face and cooled me, and by this time
having thought myself into some composure
of mind I laid my head down and slept.</p>

<p>I was awakened by Frank; day had broken,
and on looking through the porthole I saw
that it was a fine clear morning, and that the
ocean trembled with the brushing of a small
wind. I might be sure that nothing had as
yet happened; but I was so agitated, felt so
cold and pale, that I expressly lingered, hoping
to rally, till I suddenly heard the vulgar voice
of Mr. Stiles bawling my name, on which I
went out quickly.</p>

<p>&#8216;Look here, young man,&#8217; cried Mr. Stiles,
&#8216;if you&#8217;re a-going to skulk after this here
fashion I shall have to send ye forward with
a message to Mr. Balls. D&#8217;ye think I&#8217;m<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span>
a-going to do your work?&#8217; And for some
time he continued to abuse me, calling me a
little idle beast of a stowaway, a worthless,
loafing young sojer, and the like. I glanced
at him and perceived that his eyes were inflamed
and his complexion of a strange unwholesome
dye; he had evidently drunk
heavily overnight in his terror, and the fumes
of the drink were still in his head.</p>

<p>I gave him no heed, but went to my work
as usual, and presently wanting water walked
to the forecastle for a bucketful instead of to
the after-pump, as I wished to see what was
going on forward. I took a bucket from the
rack near the mainmast and went along the
alley; a gang of convicts were scrubbing
the main-deck and waist, and another gang
were washing themselves in a row near the
fore-and-aft barricade. The doctor, who always
rose very early, almost as soon as the
convicts turned out, stood at the quarter-deck
gate looking at the prisoners cleaning
the planks.</p>

<p>The last man in the line of those who
were washing themselves was Barney Abram;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span>
on catching my eye as he lifted his ugly face
out of the bucket he smiled, winked and
made a singular gesture, the significance of
which I could not gather. His back was
upon the captains or warders, and the look
he gave me was unobserved. I faintly smiled
as if I understood him, though I did not, and
went on to the forecastle.</p>

<p>The head pump was worked by one or
two ordinary seamen; the others were passing
buckets along to the boatswain and his mates
on the main-deck. I delayed to press forward
and fill my bucket, as I wished to look around
me, and made as though I waited for a
chance, in case I should be watched. The
sun was up; the eastern sky was full of pink
splendour. I saw no clouds, and the light
wind was almost directly aft. The ship floated
along very slowly. I had an eye by this time
for sea-signs and guessed we should have a
calm presently by the glassy appearance of
the horizon. I heard men calling out on
high, and, directing my eyes aloft, perceived
that the main-topgallantmast had been
wrecked to the height of the masthead&mdash;that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span>
is to say, the royal yard still lay across,
but the mast had been splintered just above
it and showed a foot or two of ragged fangs.</p>

<p>One of the seamen near me said that a
hot morning&#8217;s job lay before them. Would
they make an all-hand business of sending a
new topgallantmast aloft?</p>

<p>The other answered: &#8216;A brimstone hot
job it&#8217;s going to be, you take your haffidavy,
matey! All hands or no hands, a bleedin&#8217;
hot job&#8217;s afore some of us, roastin&#8217; as the
lightning that&#8217;s blasted that spar!&#8217; He
laughed low and spat and wiped his lips on
his wrist.</p>

<p>I knew the speaker by his voice as one of
the two seamen whose talk I had overheard.
The other stared up at the splintered topgallantmast.
It was clear that he was not in
the secret.</p>

<p>The sailor&#8217;s extraordinary speech left me
in no doubt that the attempt to seize the ship
would be made, and soon. Not a hint of
anything wrong, of anything brewing, was to
be discovered. Never had the ship worn a
quieter, peacefuller face as she floated along<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span>
this morning over the smooth, light blue of
the tropic sea, bathed in the early silver sunshine,
her canvas gleaming like silk, softly
lifting and hollowing, and all right with her
save that splintered masthead. They were
washing down the poop; I saw Will and
others hard at work with their scrubbing-brushes;
a sentry stood at the head of each
ladder, and the captain was now on deck
looking up at the injured mast and talking
about it with the ship&#8217;s carpenter. A single
sentry, as heretofore, stood at the quarter-deck
gate, another at the main-hatch door, a
third on the forecastle; thus the decks were
guarded by five armed soldiers, as usual.
Those who were off duty lounged with the
women and a few children near the booby-hatch,
waiting to get their breakfast. The
convict cooks were at work in their galley,
as I might guess from the smoke which blew
from its chimney.</p>

<p>The fate of the ship was in my hands&mdash;her
fate and the lives and fortunes of a crowd
of people! A fierce, wild pride, a wicked
exultation swelled my heart. There was yet<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span>
time! The captain was on the poop; I had
but to measure the length of the deck to
acquaint him with what I knew, and the ship
would be saved. And sooner than speak, I
would have killed myself. The blood would
be on the heads of those who had unjustly
sentenced and made a convict and a broken-hearted,
ruined man of my sweetheart. Whatever
devil had been driven into him was in
me too; what he did I would do; what he
wished would be my law; let the change that
had been worked in him be as frightful as you
please, I would lay down my life that he might
get his liberty and escape the horrors of the
base and degrading term of servitude which
he was to complete in a distant land. Yes, I
could have saved the ship by whispering a
single sentence in the captain&#8217;s ear, and had
a knife been put into my hand, and had I
been compelled either to speak or to stab my
heart, I vow to God I would have sheathed
the knife in my breast without an instant&#8217;s
hesitation.</p>

<p>I was not more than five minutes upon
the forecastle. Then drawing a bucket of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span>
water, I went aft. Captain Barrett and Lieutenant
Chimmo, as was their habit in these
sultry latitudes, quitted their cabins in their
dressing-gowns for a bath in the ship&#8217;s head.
This refreshing bath they obtained by standing
under the pump, whilst their orderlies, as
I suppose you would call the soldiers who
waited upon them, plied the handle. They
returned in twenty minutes, and disappeared
in their cabins to dress.</p>

<p>I helped Frank to drape the breakfast-table,
but every instant my eye was going
toward the open door and windows which
overlooked the quarter-deck. My hands
trembled; I frequently let things fall; and
three or four times Mr. Stiles swore at me for
a clumsy young fool and threatened me with
Mr. Balls. Frank asked me what was the
matter, and I told him I supposed my nerves
had been shaken by the storm.</p>

<p>I think it was about a quarter to eight
when Captain Barrett and the subaltern
emerged from their berths. As they walked
to the companion-steps to go on deck, the
captain and the doctor descended, and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span>
four came to a stand at the foot of the ladder
and talked. I strained my ear. Their chatter
was of the lightest&mdash;the weather, the wrecked
topgallantmast, the soldier who had tumbled
down in a fit and who was now well.</p>

<p>Suddenly Mr. Masters, who was on the
poop&mdash;whether in charge of the watch or not,
I can&#8217;t say&mdash;put his head into the skylight
and cried out in a voice loud with
terror:</p>

<p>&#8216;Captain Sutherland, the convicts are
breaking out! Some of our men have
knocked the forecastle sentry down! Quick
on deck! The main-hatch sentry&#8217;s over-powered
and the prisoners are pouring up!&#8217;</p>

<p>Just as he spoke a musket was fired&mdash;then
a second. Some of the women shrieked.
A third musket was fired. This was followed
by an indescribable roaring noise of groans
and yells, accompanied by the sound of the
tread of many feet. The captain and the
doctor rushed on deck, the two military
officers to their cabins, out of which they
broke again in a twinkling, each man pulling
a pistol out of its case as he ran toward the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span>
companion-way and flinging the case down as
he bounded up the steps.</p>

<p>&#8216;Here they are!&#8217; shouted the steward, and,
followed by Frank, he fled to the steps which
led to the poop.</p>

<p>A mass of the convicts were coming
toward the recess where the soldiers&#8217; arms
were. Gaining the steerage hatchway in a
leap or two, I rushed into my cabin, and as I
closed my door and bolted it I heard the
prisoners shouting as they swarmed into the
cuddy. Their footsteps thundered over my
head. I saw myself in the wash-stand looking-glass,
and was as white as milk. I was only
sensible now of the horror that had seized me
at the sight of the faces of the convicts. I
stood with my hand upon my heart, holding
by the side of the upper bunk, breathing fast
and listening. But voices could not pierce
the thickness of the deck-plank. Nothing
took my ear but the confused tread and
shuffling movements of feet overhead like to
what I had heard when I lay in hiding, only
softer because of the carpets.</p>

<p>A horrid fancy seized me. Shots had been<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[266]</span>
fired. Suppose Tom had been wounded or
killed! The handle of the door was violently
tried and the door shaken and beaten upon.
I cried out: &#8216;Who&#8217;s that?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Will Johnstone! Let me in!&#8217;</p>

<p>I rushed to the door and opened it, and
Will entered. In the time that the door lay
open I heard a great shouting and hoarse
roaring, distant, as though a fierce struggle
were happening on the main-deck, likewise a
single musket-shot. This I heard whilst I let
Will in. He was deadly white; his eyes were
large and strange with a wild stare of horror.</p>

<p>For some moments he could utter no
words.</p>

<p>&#8216;Are you hurt?&#8217; I exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8216;No, but I have seen&mdash;but I have seen&mdash;oh,
the bloody villains! One stabbed Chimmo
in the throat, and they threw him overboard
alive. He levelled his pistol and shot a man.
He was mad to do it. He stood no chance.
They wrenched the musket out of a sentry&#8217;s
hand and bayoneted him and tossed him into
the sea, alive like the subaltern.&#8217;</p>

<p>Horror overcame the poor fellow. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span>
memory of the shocking sights seemed to
paralyse him; his jaw moved, but he ceased
to speak. I was horror-stricken too, but not
as he, for he had beheld what he described.
But impatience was rending my heart; I could
not give him time.</p>

<p>&#8216;Have you seen Tom?&#8217;</p>

<p>He answered with a nod.</p>

<p>&#8216;Is he safe?&#8217;</p>

<p>The poor lad dryly swallowed and wiped
his blanched lips and said huskily: &#8216;Yes; he
told me to run to this cabin and keep with
you. He&#8217;ll be here soon. He stays to save
Mr. Bates&#8217;s life.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;The convicts will not hurt us,&#8217; said I.
&#8216;Tom stipulated for our safety.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I guessed that,&#8217; he exclaimed. &#8216;When
they rushed upon the poop they struck out
and stabbed to right and left of them, but
none offered to hurt me. Butler stood on
the ladder where the sentry had been
bayoneted.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;He didn&#8217;t do it?&#8217; I shrieked.</p>

<p>&#8216;No; it was a young convict with a
purple face, who kept yelling like a madman.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span>
Butler stood on the ladder and shouted to
me, and I ran to him. He put his arm round
my neck and said: &#8220;Will, it&#8217;s a bloody business.
I could have stopped it by peaching,
but they would have killed me; and what
was to become of Marian?&#8221; A line of convicts
was drawn across the quarter-deck, and they
saw Butler with his arm round my neck.
He told me that he had seen you run into the
steerage and that I should find you in your
cabin.&#8217;</p>

<p>He was now beginning to breathe with
more freedom, and something of the dreadful,
staring look was passing out of his eyes. He
listened and then said: &#8216;They&#8217;ll not hurt us.
Butler seems to have authority. Did he plan
this frightful business?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;No, but he would not hinder it. Why
should he? He&#8217;s an innocent man, and must
have his liberty. Let those who swore his
freedom away, who sentenced him, who have
ruined our lives and made him what he is, be
responsible for this.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;It couldn&#8217;t have happened,&#8217; he exclaimed,
&#8216;but for our men. Many of them are as vile<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span>
as the worst of the convicts. I was on the
poop and saw it all, and it was as quickly
done as letting go a topsail-halliards. The
prisoners&#8217; messmen massed themselves as usual
past the main-hatch at breakfast-time; I
noticed some of our sailors loafing near the
convicts&#8217; galley within leap of the main-hatch
sentry. I also saw a cluster of seamen standing
close in the way of the forecastle sentry&#8217;s
walk. I heard a loud shout; I&#8217;ll swear it was
the prize-fighter&#8217;s voice. In an instant the
forecastle sentry was knocked down by the
seamen; the main-hatch sentry was seized
from behind and disarmed by the sailors who
rushed from the convicts&#8217; galley. The messmen
threw down their breakfast utensils as a
sort of second signal; I watched and saw it
all, Marian; quicker than I can talk the convicts
on deck made for the quarter-deck
barricade-gate, and fast as water pours
through a scupper-hole the prisoners came
streaming up out of their quarters. The
quarter-deck sentry levelled his piece and
fired, and a convict dropped. The convicts
forced the gate; the sentry bayoneted the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span>
first of them and was then knocked down;
his musket was wrested from him, and a
brutal ruffian beat his head in with the stock
as the poor fellow lay on his back. The
poop sentries fired at the convicts as they
burst through the barrier, but in a few
moments the prisoners got possession of the
arms in the recess and swarmed up by either
ladder. Oh, it was a splendid, maddening,
frightful sight to see those two soldiers, one
at each ladder, holding the steps against the
yelling mob until one was beaten down and
killed as I have told you!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Hark to the noise overhead!&#8217; I cried.
&#8216;The cuddy is full of men!&#8217;</p>

<p>Through the open porthole came faintly,
like voices at a distance across the water,
sounds of the shouting on deck. The wind
had dropped. A sheet calm had fallen.
Through the cabin window I saw the sea
stretching to its dim, hot confines in a vast
spread of soft silver blue, with scarce a
breathing of swell to stir the ship.</p>

<p>&#8216;What have they done with the captain?&#8217;
I asked.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span>&#8216;As I ran to join Butler, a crowd of convicts
gathered round the captain and doctor,
as though to force them off the poop. I don&#8217;t
think they hurt them.&#8217;</p>

<p>I asked some other questions. He had
rallied, and now talked with something of
composure.</p>

<p>&#8216;Hush!&#8217; cried he suddenly. &#8216;There are
people outside.&#8217;</p>

<p>The door of the cabin next mine was
beaten. Mine was then hammered on.</p>

<p>&#8216;Are you there, Johnstone?&#8217;</p>

<p>It was Tom, and in a heart-beat I threw
open the door. Beside him stood Mr. Bates,
the chief officer of the ship. On my showing
myself, Tom extended his arms and gathered
me to his breast and held me tight. I broke
into a little passion of sobs, but shed no
tears.</p>

<p>&#8216;You are free,&#8217; I cried, drawing from him
and grasping his hands and looking into his
dear eyes.</p>

<p>&#8216;Not yet! Not yet!&#8217; he answered
hoarsely, as though his voice had been
strained by shouting. &#8216;But, dear heart, we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span>
are together and may talk together now. Mr.
Bates, step in.&#8217;</p>

<p>They were alone. He shut the door when
the mate entered.</p>

<p>&#8216;This is Marian Johnstone, the lady I was
to have married, the lady who accompanied
me on board this ship in the East India Docks.
She followed me into this accursed vessel and,
herself a woman of wealth and a lady by
birth, has waited at your table, stooped to
the vile drudgery of the cuddy, worked like
a convict, associated with men no better than
convicts, that she might be in sympathy with
me in my degradation. May she find a reward!&#8217;
he cried, raising his hands and speaking
in a broken voice. &#8216;Do you stare, Mr.
Bates? Why, yes, to be sure; she was a boy
and a cabin bottle-washer to your habit of
thought down to a minute ago. But the
secret of her sex is yours. This is her cousin,
Will. Sir, on your honour, this lady is still a
boy amongst us, and you know nothing. Consider
our company. Give me your hand
upon it.&#8217;</p>

<p>Mr. Bates extended his hand, and Tom<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span>
grasped it. The mate was a man of a somewhat
slow turn of mind. He looked at me
hard whilst he retained his grasp of my sweetheart&#8217;s
hand, and said: &#8216;I have been thinking
as much for some time. There never was a
boy with your skin and eyes. Butler&#8217;s a
lucky man!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;A wronged man!&#8217; I cried.</p>

<p>&#8216;I said so when I read the papers, and
I&#8217;ve been saying it ever since aboard this
ship, as you know, Johnstone.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;She shipped as Simon Marlowe,&#8217; said
Tom, &#8216;and so she remains&mdash;that&#8217;s understood.
Mr. Bates, you stop here with her and Johnstone.
I&#8217;ll bring Abram and others presently.
The wolves are tearing the cuddy to pieces in
their rage to eat and drink. No man&#8217;ll harm
you as my friend. You three are my friends&mdash;friends!&#8217;
he cried, and again he took me
in his arms and held me to him, then passionately
broke away and said, speaking fast
and harshly and with a fierceness I had
noticed in his whispers: &#8216;They&#8217;ll not hurt
you! The devils are helpless without me.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span>
There&#8217;s not a navigator amongst them. It
was concerted I was to take charge, and I do
so on my own terms.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What have they done with the captain?&#8217;
cried Mr. Bates.</p>

<p>&#8216;He&#8217;s in the prisoners&#8217; quarters along with
the doctor and Captain Barrett and the survivors
of the guard. I fear the bad part of
your sailors more than the convicts. There
must be no bloodshed. But let them yell and
roar. Give the mad spirits of the brutes time
to languish. They have their liberty, but it
is not the liberty of the shore, and they&#8217;ll not
know what to do with it presently when they
sober down and look around. Marian, my
brave heart!&#8217; For the third time he pressed
me to him and stepped out, bidding us leave
the door unbolted and to stay till he returned.</p>

<p>His face was white, hard and wild; his
manner that of one who is full of rage and
whose struggle to command it fills his eyes
with the light of madness. Mr. Bates gazed
at me when the door closed upon my sweetheart,
and, plunging his hands in his pockets,
said: &#8216;I owe him my life. He locked me in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span>
my cabin, and a number of the convicts were
forcing the door when he thrust through and
brought me out. He shouted: &#8220;Men, I have
three friends; two are youngsters below, this
is the third. You know our compact. You
know who this man is. You have seen him
often enough. He is an old shipmate of mine
and a friend, and if a hair of his is harmed,
you sail the ship yourselves.&#8221; The cuddy was
full of convicts; but there fell a silence whilst
he roared this out. He has a noble voice.
He put his arm through mine and walked me
to the hatch. The devils fell away from me
and started shouting on other matters, as
though I was out of it and concerned them no
longer. He saved my life. They&#8217;ve killed
poor Masters. They would have killed me.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Is the second mate dead?&#8217; gasped Will.</p>

<p>&#8216;Butler told me so. Masters showed fight
when they killed the sentry and rushed on to
the poop, and he was cut down. So Butler
told me as we came here. The convicts got
hold of the soldiers&#8217; arms, and it was all done
out of hand. And what&#8217;s to become of the
ship?&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span>&#8216;What will they do with the captain and
the doctor?&#8217; said Will.</p>

<p>&#8216;How many have been killed?&#8217; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8216;Three convicts were dropped by the sentries,&#8217;
answered Will. &#8216;Suppose them dead.
Then two soldiers. Then the lieutenant and
Mr. Masters. The tally&#8217;ll run to near half a
score, sir,&#8217; said he, looking at the mate.</p>

<p>&#8216;And you&#8217;re a cousin of this lady?&#8217; said
Mr. Bates.</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8217;m no lady on board this ship. Pray
take heed, sir!&#8217; I cried.</p>

<p>&#8216;She has nothing to do with this business!&#8217;
cried my cousin. &#8216;She was afraid of losing
sight of Captain Butler if she followed him in
another ship.&#8217;</p>

<p>The poor man durst not ask questions, for
fear of offending me.</p>

<p>&#8216;What noise is that?&#8217; cried Will.</p>

<p>I heard a kind of pounding, like the stroke
of a pump or the hitting of timber. Mr. Bates
put his head out of the door to listen. A
dull, confused tumult of voices came down
the hatch&mdash;wild cries as of mad or drunken
delight; but I seemed to catch a level note<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span>
in the hubbub, and supposed that the first
delirium and wild-beast-like transports were
passing.</p>

<p>Mr. Bates was about to shut the door,
when he was arrested by a noise of rushing
feet. He looked out, and said: &#8216;Here&#8217;s a
mob of convicts streaming into the steerage!&#8217;</p>

<p>I pushed past him and took the door-handle
from his grasp, opened the door wide,
and stood in the way. The convicts were
abreast of me in a moment, twenty or thirty
of them. They shouted as they ran, using
language which has gone from my memory.
I guessed they had come to sack the cabins
down here, from the nature of their shouts
one to another; but they roared so hoarsely,
their oaths were so plentiful and unintelligible,
their speech so hard to understand, some
of them being of the provinces, that I could
only conjecture their designs. My voice,
though contralto, was piercing and clear. I
cried out: &#8216;Do you know who we are?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Ain&#8217;t they Butler&#8217;s lot?&#8217; shouted one of
them.</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes, the three of us,&#8217; I cried. &#8216;He&#8217;ll be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span>
here in a moment, along with Barney Abram.
We&#8217;re keeping out of the muddle above till
you&#8217;ve found out who&#8217;s your friends.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;It&#8217;s the spunky young devil as jawed the
doctor,&#8217; said a voice.</p>

<p>&#8216;This is my cabin,&#8217; said I. &#8216;There&#8217;s nothing
to take in it. But what&#8217;s your friend&#8217;s,
he keeps, don&#8217;t he? Look here! I&#8217;ve been
with you, if not of you, and tasted every joy
of yours but your irons, curse them!&#8217; and
with a swaggering, bouncing, rollicking manner
I sprang to my bunk and pulled out the
convict mattress and pillow and flung them
on the deck. &#8216;No. 240,&#8217; I cried, pointing,
and forcing a shout of laughter.</p>

<p>Some of the convicts echoed that insane
burst of merriment. Their laughter was
hideous with its note of raw hoarseness.</p>

<p>&#8216;What&#8217;s that bundle there?&#8217; cried one
of them, a heavy-jawed, low-browed ruffian.</p>

<p>&#8216;Skins and yacks and dummies is it, my
bulger? Where&#8217;s your pal?&#8217; cried another
man.</p>

<p>&#8216;Show out! Show out!&#8217; roared a third
voice.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span>&#8216;It&#8217;s woman&#8217;s clothes. Look and then let
them be,&#8217; I cried, still preserving my bouncing,
dare-devil air.</p>

<p>They were elbowing in; the atmosphere
was sickening with the fellows&#8217; warm, hard
breathing. Many of them, I judged, had got
at the cuddy stock of liquor. Will and the
mate stood side by side in a corner. Never
shall I forget the show of faces that confronted
me; men with broken noses; one
with a hare-lip; one with a diabolical squint.
Some were gray, two or three a flaming red.
But the features and colour counted for nothing;
their looks were devilish and horrible,
and the prevailing expression an infuriate
triumph of the basest spirits, inflamed by
drink and animated yet by the brutal and
maddening lust of plunder.</p>

<p>At this instant I heard Tom&#8217;s voice at the
back of the crowd. He cried out: &#8216;Is this
fair? Is this how their promises are to be
kept? What have they done? Abram, help
me to clear this cabin.&#8217;</p>

<p>The rearmost of the convicts were violently
twisted out of the doorway; as Tom forced<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[280]</span>
his way in, the fellows reeled to the thrust of
his elbows. Abram was shouting: &#8216;Out, you
cub! A bargid&#8217;s a bargid. You&#8217;ve no right
here!&#8217; And whilst he shouted he lay about
him, and some of the men absolutely flew
before the prodigious thrust of his arm,
tumbling others down as they bounded, until
perhaps a dozen of the felons lay sprawling
in the passage outside the cabin door, cursing,
roaring, laughing and filling the place with
the infernal din of a madhouse.</p>

<p>&#8216;Is it all right with you, Marlowe?&#8217; cried
Tom passionately.</p>

<p>&#8216;All right,&#8217; I answered, &#8216;and right also
with our two friends.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Dow look here!&#8217; exclaimed Barney
Abram, whom I did not instantly recognise,
for he had removed his convict clothes and
wore a long pea-coat, cap and trousers belonging
to Captain Sutherland. &#8216;Look here!&#8217;
he exclaimed, addressing the convicts, who
stood in a crowd at the cabin door. &#8216;Our
agreebet with Butler was that his two yug
freds was to be let alode. It was probised.
Why dote you keep your word? D&#8217;ye dow<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span>
where y&#8217; are? You&#8217;re at sea, and there&#8217;s dot
a bad you cad trust the ship to but Butler,&#8217;
and here he put his immense hand upon Tom&#8217;s
shoulder. &#8216;There&#8217;s a third party he&#8217;s asked
our kideness for. He shall have it. We owe
hib do grudge. The chief bate of this ship&#8217;s
always beed a quiet bad. Did ady bad ever
hear hib slig a hard word at a prisoder? He&#8217;s
Butler&#8217;s fred, ad that&#8217;s edough. Butler&#8217;s our
fred, ad&#8217;ll carry you in safety to where you
bay scatter. Ate that what you want?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;We never came &#8217;ere to &#8217;urt &#8217;em,&#8217; said one
of the convicts.</p>

<p>&#8216;D&#8217;ye know them now?&#8217; shouted Tom.
&#8216;Look, and tell all hands of you, fore and aft,
that these three are my friends and are not to
be molested. If they are not well used by
you all, if the smallest injury befalls them
through any one of you, I instantly chuck the
job of navigating the ship. You may threaten
me; you may torture me; you may hang me.
I&#8217;ll fling the navigating instruments overboard,
and leave the ship to drown you on a lee
shore or to run foul of an English man-of-war.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[282]</span>I cannot express the savageness with
which he spoke; the hatred and contempt
with which he surveyed the crowd of ugly
rascals.</p>

<p>&#8216;That&#8217;s plaid English! Are you satisfied?&#8217;
cried Barney Abram, clapping his hands on
his thighs and stooping and howling his words
at them.</p>

<p>&#8216;Come along, bullies! No use wasting
time here!&#8217; cried a voice.</p>

<p>In a moment the convicts broke away.
They burst into the cabin next door and filled
the pantry, and I heard them laughing and
yelling as they flung the food they found at one
another and dashed the crockery against the
bulkhead. Tom shut the door.</p>

<p>&#8216;Ad &#8217;ow are you, yug gentlebud?&#8217; said
Abram, offering me his hand. &#8216;So the doctor
wadted to bake be your pal, eh? He preaches
a good serbud,&#8217; he added, shutting one eye
and looking at Mr. Bates. &#8216;What d&#8217;ye thik
of this, sir, for a piece of orgadisatiod? Is it
prettily badaged?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;It is grandly managed,&#8217; said I, answering
for the mate, who seemed incapable of speech,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>[283]</span>
and who stood staring at the repulsive, massive,
small-poxed face and wonderful figure of
the prize-fighter with looks of dread and
aversion. &#8216;You, Mr. Abram, will have been
the genius of this splendid stroke.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I thik I bay claib to &#8217;ave &#8217;ad a small &#8217;ad
in it,&#8217; he answered, with an indescribable
smirk of self-complacency, as he gazed at
Tom.</p>

<p>&#8216;Hark at those brutes outside!&#8217; cried my
sweetheart. &#8216;There&#8217;ll be no navigation,
there&#8217;ll be nothing to be done with the ship
if those hell-hounds are not to be brought
under some sort of government.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;You bust let theb howl it out of thebselves.
They&#8217;ve got at the drik and that&#8217;s
dot going to quiet &#8217;eb,&#8217; said Abram. &#8216;Perhaps
sub of theb will be jubping overboard presedly,
or going for each other with the soldiers&#8217;
sballarbs; we&#8217;re rather duberous.&#8217;</p>

<p>He spoke with a great affectation of gentility
and superiority. At any other time
I should have burst into a fit of laughter at
the fellow&#8217;s grotesque, genteel air, coupled
with the indescribable leering smirk of self-complacency<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>[284]</span>
that was fixed upon his pitted
face.</p>

<p>&#8216;Captain Butler, what use can you make
of me?&#8217; said Mr. Bates, finding his voice on a
sudden. &#8216;I owe you my life, and I want to
prove myself grateful, and I want to show
myself grateful for Mr. Abram&#8217;s friendship
and protection.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Let Mr. Bates go and take charge of the
deck,&#8217; said Tom, looking at Abram.</p>

<p>Abram, with a cunning grin, shook his
head. &#8216;Trust the ship to wud of her bates!
Reckon that he&#8217;s going to steer you to the
port agreed upod for our dispersal? He&#8217;ll
wait upod you!&#8217; said Abram.</p>

<p>&#8216;The ship must be watched,&#8217; said Tom.
&#8216;Suppose a squall should burst down upon
us! Suppose something with paddle-wheels
and a white pennant flying should heave into
sight!&#8217; he added with an oath which I had
never before heard in his mouth, and looking
Abram fiercely in the face as he spoke. &#8216;How
am I to teach these wretches common-sense?
The ship must be watched!&#8217; he shouted.
&#8216;Am I to be your only man? Is it to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285"></a>[285]</span>
a twenty-four-hours&#8217; look-out with me day
after day until I bring you in sight of the
land we agree to make? Bates, you are
still first mate of this ship under me. You
won&#8217;t go wrong. You&#8217;ll have no chance.
I&#8217;d blow out the brains of any man who&#8217;d
imperil the liberty I&#8217;ve regained this morning!&#8217;</p>

<p>His eyes flashed, his face filled with blood,
he took a step and put his arms round my
neck and stood so, scarcely sensible, it seemed
to me, of what he did.</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8217;ll back you, Tom!&#8217; said I. &#8216;The liberty
you&#8217;ve this day got you&#8217;ll keep.&#8217;</p>

<p>Abram burst out laughing. I felt, and
was amazed to feel Tom&#8217;s influence over this
ruffian.</p>

<p>&#8216;Your little fred&#8217;s got the spu&#8217;k, Butler,&#8217;
said he. &#8216;A bugful of it wouldn&#8217;t hurt that
lad there,&#8217; he continued, nodding at Will.</p>

<p>&#8216;He is my cousin,&#8217; said I. &#8216;Don&#8217;t question
his courage. He&#8217;s fresh from seeing men
butchered and thrown alive overboard. You
are the greatest fighter in all England, with
the finest endurance and pluck of any man<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286"></a>[286]</span>
that ever entered a ring; therefore, Mr.
Abram, you have a soft heart. Courage
and kindness go hand in hand. Bear with
that lad. He is horror-stricken.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Do deed for such sedsatiods, by warbler,&#8217;
said the prize-fighter, grinning with gratification
and stepping up to Will. &#8216;Give us your
arb. I&#8217;ll take yours, Bates. Dow let&#8217;s step
od deck. I wadt air ad a drink.&#8217;</p>

<small>SHE DESCRIBES THE BEHAVIOUR OF THE
CONVICTS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> their going out, Tom shut the door and
locked it, then, catching me in his arms,
called me by twenty caressing words and
kissed and blessed me for my love and devotion.
I cried and lost my self-control, and
some time elapsed before we were composed
enough to talk. He then spoke of the <i>Arab
Chief</i>, and told me again how the conspiracy
against him had been contrived. His face
blackened and he turned motionless with
wrath when he mentioned Rotch and the
other. I see him now after he had said:
&#8216;Marian, I swear by and before the great and
just and merciful God of Heaven that I am
as guiltless of the crime for which I am here
as you, and that Rotch and Nodder&mdash;&mdash;&#8217;
Then he stopped. He stood without a stir,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288"></a>[288]</span>
his face blackened, and his eyes became enlarged
and fixed. Nothing moved but his
lips, which convulsively opened and shut. His
expression was one of horror and dreadful
rage.</p>

<p>I was terrified, and threw my arms round
his neck and kissed him. He fetched two or
three deep sighs, and picked his convict cap
out of the upper bunk and fanned himself
with it. He then quickly rallied, but turned
as deadly pale as his looks had before been
black and terrible, and held me by the hand
a minute, watching me with a smile of heart-moving
sadness. &#8216;But God will not suffer it!
But God will not suffer it!&#8217; he muttered
brokenly; and a minute later, in a collected
voice, he talked to me of his sufferings in the
London jails, of what he had endured on
board the hulk and in the dockyard.</p>

<p>I strove to bring him away from these
maddening memories by speaking of myself,
but I presently saw it did him good to let
loose his thoughts.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, a second mob of convicts,
attracted by the noise below, had come down<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289"></a>[289]</span>
into the steerage and were swelling the chorus
of yells and oaths which the felons were roaring
out. I heard a frequent splintering of
wood, as though drawers and doors and
lockers were being forced and smashed. The
ruffians&#8217; object, unless it were diabolic wantonness,
I could not imagine; the cabins
there were few. One was full of some kind
of stores; then there was the pantry; the
other berths were empty; maybe the villains
beat and splintered the woodwork and did
what injury they could with the tools they
handled out of rage and spite at being baulked
in their hunt for booty.</p>

<p>&#8216;Do they mean to wreck the ship?&#8217; said I.
&#8216;Are they men or beasts? Listen to them!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;They&#8217;re beasts! Don&#8217;t I know! But
why do they shout and roar? After the long
discipline of silence, I could roar myself. It
has made a devil of me.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;What you are, I am,&#8217; said I.</p>

<p>He shook his head passionately, and said:
&#8216;My business will be to get out of this ship
with you quickly. They trust me, and their
trust will be my opportunity. How long<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"></a>[290]</span>
should I keep you in this ship of demons?
There&#8217;s Bates and there&#8217;s young Johnstone.
I have a scheme. The three of us are
sailors.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Are the convicts without any chiefs,
without any head they are willing to own?
If there&#8217;s no discipline, what must happen?
They&#8217;ll get at the liquor; they&#8217;ll eat and
waste the provisions; they&#8217;ll knock the ship
to pieces and sink her. Is that the wretches&#8217;
idea of liberty?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;There are heads; Abram&#8217;s one. There
are others I needn&#8217;t name. I&#8217;m supposed to
be one, as taking charge of the ship. They&#8217;ll
fall into some sort of order by-and-by. Many
of them are not wholly beasts, and they&#8217;ll
understand for their lives&#8217; sake what&#8217;s wanted
and what must be done. Marian, I had no
hand in this business. They asked me if I&#8217;d
navigate the ship if the prisoners seized her.
I said yes, and that that would be my share
in the outbreak. I&#8217;d do no more; I&#8217;d have
no man&#8217;s blood upon my head. If they seized
the ship, good and well; I&#8217;d navigate her to
any agreed part of the world. Understand<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291"></a>[291]</span>
me, Marian, I am accountable for no life that
has been lost to-day. What is that bundle?&#8217;</p>

<p>I explained.</p>

<p>&#8216;The clothes may prove useful,&#8217; said he.
He pointed to the convict&#8217;s mattress on deck
and said, &#8216;Has that been your bed?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes, dear.&#8217;</p>

<p>He tossed his hands and looked at me
with a face of sorrow and love, then put the
parcel into my bunk and the mattress on top
of it.</p>

<p>&#8216;They&#8217;ll give me the captain&#8217;s cabin,&#8217; said
he, &#8216;and you must be near me. I couldn&#8217;t
rest to think of you sleeping down here. The
men&#8217;ll be filling these cabins; they&#8217;ll sleep in
bowlines over the side sooner than occupy the
prisoners&#8217; quarters, though many of them&#8217;ll
have to live down there all the same. Come
with me on deck. I must see what&#8217;s doing.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Be careful how you address me, Tom.
I must be thought a boy whilst I am in this
ship.&#8217;</p>

<p>We went out, and he locked the door after
him and gave me the key. He shouted to the
convicts, some of whom seemed to be dancing,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292"></a>[292]</span>
others playing at leap-frog, whilst others
again ran in and out of the pantry and cabins
hallooing like madmen: &#8216;Let no man enter
that berth! My friend occupies it, and that&#8217;s
enough!&#8217; He then passed his arm through
mine, and we walked to the steps of the hatch
that led into the cuddy.</p>

<p>I never could have imagined such a scene
as this interior presented. Most of the tall,
thin sheets of looking-glass had been shivered.
The doors of the cabins lay open, and the
decks were covered with the tossed and tumbled
contents of rifled drawers, lockers, and
boxes. The convicts had found good booty
in these cabins. Here had slept the captain,
the two mates, the military officers, and the
surgeon-superintendent, and one or two spare
berths aft had been filled with certain valuable
consignments to Sydney, to which port the
ship was to have proceeded after discharging
her cargo of criminals at Hobart Town.</p>

<p>The place was crowded with the felons.
They stood two and three deep at the table,
which, as you will remember, I and my associate
had prepared for breakfast. One of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293"></a>[293]</span>
aftermost berths had been used as a cabin
larder; here the prisoners had found plenty
to eat and drink. The table was strewn with
tins of meat, pots of preserves, bottles of beer,
biscuits, bones of ham, and so forth. The
fellows bawled to one another to pass this and
that; to hand the ale along; to sling that
bottle of sherry across. They knocked the
heads off the bottles and, after emptying them,
threw them on the deck.</p>

<p>The drink had mounted into the heads of
many, and the din of their shouts, songs, and
laughter, their filthy language and hideous
raillery, would have drowned the noise of a
thunderstorm. Here and there lay portions
of convicts&#8217; clothes torn into shreds. Many
of the felons were dressed in plundered
apparel. A man at the foot of the table wore
the doctor&#8217;s naval coat; others the clothes
which had belonged to Lieutenant Chimmo
and Captain Barrett. A few had attired
themselves in the uniforms of these officers,
one in a tunic, another in the trousers, a third
in a military cloak. One fellow who ran past
us had the subaltern&#8217;s sword strapped to his hip.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294"></a>[294]</span>&#8216;Which was the captain&#8217;s cabin?&#8217; said
Tom.</p>

<p>We looked into it; it had been sacked
like the rest; the lockers opened and the
contents looted; the lid of a large sea-chest
was smashed as though by a chopper; but
they had left the nautical instruments alone,
perhaps guessing their importance. The
chronometers were safe; there were sextants
in their cases on a shelf; the nautical books
of reference were untouched; but the charts
had been emptied out of their bags, as though
the convicts supposed more was to be found
inside them than rolls of paper.</p>

<p>We stepped on to the main-deck. The
barricades had been beaten down, and the
decks were covered with chips and fragments
of timber. I now understood what had occasioned
the pounding noise I had heard. A
dreadful stain of blood marked the spot where
the quarter-deck sentry had been felled. A
couple of convicts stood with muskets and
fixed bayonets at the main-hatch. Some food
and bottles of beer were beside them, and
they drank and ate, and chatted in harsh<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295"></a>[295]</span>
syllables. The doors and barricade arrangements
here had been demolished. Gratings
covered the hatch. The cage-like bars which
descended to the lower-deck, with the doorway
to admit of the passage of but one man
at a time, still remained. I supposed that
the door in the steerage bulkhead was secured
and guarded.</p>

<p>Thirty or forty convicts lingered about
this part of the ship. They seemed the quietest
portion of the vile rabble. They hung in
groups or marched up and down in little
gangs. Some were dressed in the clothes of
the soldiers. Others, again, wore the jackets
and coats of the seamen and soldiers. It was
clear that the forecastle and barracks had
been stormed and plundered, though possibly
the chests of the loyal portion of the crew
only had been rifled.</p>

<p>I looked about me for the sailors, and
counted five or six talking to a little crowd
of convicts near the ship&#8217;s galley. I saw
nothing of Mr. Balls nor the other petty
officers of the vessel. Tom said he supposed
they had been driven below with the orderly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296"></a>[296]</span>
part of the crew and were in the prisoners&#8217;
quarters together with the captain, the doctor,
Captain Barrett, the survivors of the guard,
the women, and others.</p>

<p>There might have been fifty or sixty convicts
upon the poop. I spied Will standing
beside a convict right aft. I took the man to
be a convict until I had stared awhile, and
then I saw it was Mr. Bates, the chief mate,
who had evidently been forced to change
clothes with a felon. Will, however, was
dressed as usual. The wheel was deserted.
The calm was profound; the sea flat and
sheeting into the dim, hot distance like a surface
of quicksilver. The sun was now high
and pouring in splendour into the vast mirror
of the deep, and his light was stinging with
heat, early as the hour yet was.</p>

<p>A convict, flushed with drink, reeled up
to me and shouted: &#8216;Here&#8217;s one that ain&#8217;t of
us! Change clothes, my beauty! Off with
them duds!&#8217; and he pulled at his own coat in
a drunken, wrestling way to remove it.</p>

<p>Tom took him by the throat, and, running
him backward until he was abreast of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297"></a>[297]</span>
convicts&#8217; galley, flung him into the door with
a bitter curse, and the fellow fell with a
crash. My sweetheart shouted to the mob of
convicts who stood near the ship&#8217;s galley with
the sailors:</p>

<p>&#8216;Keep that drunken ruffian off me or I
shall kill him! D&#8217;ye know my compact? If
this lad is touched or hurt&#8217;&mdash;and he stepped
back to put his hand on my shoulder, whilst
he roared out these words in a voice of fury&mdash;&#8216;you
shall sail the ship amongst you!
You shall run her ashore and drown every
mother&#8217;s son aboard! You shall run her into
a man-of-war, and find as many gibbets as you
have necks!&#8217;</p>

<p>As he spoke, the drunken convict staggered
out of the galley with blood on his face
from his nose: he cursed wildly and incoherently,
and was approaching Tom in a
fighting posture.</p>

<p>&#8216;It&#8217;s all right, Butler,&#8217; bawled a felon, &#8216;get
away aft to your quarters and look to the
ship!&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;It&#8217;s time!&#8217; cried a seaman, and as this
was said three of the convicts sprang upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298"></a>[298]</span>
the drunken convict and thrust him back into
the galley.</p>

<p>&#8216;Lie there!&#8217; roared one of them. &#8216;Seizing
the ship ain&#8217;t getting our liberty, curse you!&#8217;</p>

<p>Tom took my arm and we went toward
the poop. I was terribly frightened. I shuddered
and trembled, and said: &#8216;Where shall
I find some convicts&#8217; clothes? Think if I
should be forced to change when you were
not by to stop it!&#8217;</p>

<p>He halted at the foot of the poop-ladder
and said: &#8216;Put this on and give me yours,&#8217;
and pulled off his convict coat. It was large
and loose, and a more effectual disguise than
Will&#8217;s serge jacket or my monkey-coat. It
was Will&#8217;s serge that I handed Tom. He
found it small and tossed it to a young
convict who stood grinning at us whilst we
changed coats.</p>

<p>&#8216;I&#8217;ll find clothes when I want them,&#8217; said
he, and I followed him up the ladder.</p>

<p>There were several stains of blood about
the poop-deck. The sight made me ill. Tom
saw the sickness in my face and exclaimed:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299"></a>[299]</span>
&#8216;The heat is too much for you. Go aft to
your cousin; I&#8217;ll join you in a minute.&#8217; He
then, standing at the brass rail, shouted: &#8216;Aft,
a couple of hands, and spread the awning;
and lay aft a hand to the wheel! Do you
hear?&#8217;</p>

<p>Strained as his voice had been by previous
exertion, it still rang clear and high, and went
through the ship with the carrying note of a
bell. I paused when he shouted, and took
notice that the convicts on the poop, who
were as fairly orderly as the fellows in the
waist, looked pleased on hearing him utter
this command.</p>

<p>He followed me, and we joined Mr. Bates
and Will. Despite my sickness, I found a
difficulty in holding my face when I viewed
Mr. Bates dressed as a convict. He immediately
said, addressing me: &#8216;I see they have
figged you out, also, but not to the heels, as
I am. A fellow laid hold of me, though
Abram had my arm with Johnstone on
t&#8217;other side to let the gentry see that we were
friends. Abram said: &#8220;Change with him.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300"></a>[300]</span>
You&#8217;ll be safer in that dress and they&#8217;ll like
you the better in it.&#8221;&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;He&#8217;s right,&#8217; said Tom.</p>

<p>Two sailors came aft to loose the little
awning; a third man approached the wheel.
He looked hard at Mr. Bates and burst into
a laugh. The mate wisely turned his back
upon him to conceal his temper, and held his
peace.</p>

<p>It was no moment then to resent an insult,
though this scoundrel seaman had been in
Mr. Bates&#8217;s watch since the beginning of the
voyage, and, with the rest of the sailors, had
always been well used by him. Tom stepped
up to the fellow and exclaimed in a tone of
severity that made the man shrink: &#8216;I suppose
that you know I am the commander of
this ship now?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yes, sir.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;And I suppose you know that you are an
infernal mutineer?&#8217;</p>

<p>The man stared at him in a hang-dog
way; he was the fellow who had spoken on
the forecastle that morning about the roasting
job which lay before them.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301"></a>[301]</span>&#8216;My command,&#8217; continued Tom, hissing
his speech into the sailor&#8217;s face, &#8216;gives me unlimited
power, and if I insist upon your being
hanged, up you go! Mr. Bates is second in
command, and he is your chief mate still.
Laugh again if you dare!&#8217;</p>

<p>He lingered to stare at the man, who
shuffled, spat, looked uneasily around him,
but made no reply.</p>

<p>&#8216;Bear a hand with that awning, then,&#8217;
shouted my sweetheart to the two seamen.
&#8216;Larking, Jephson, Simmonds,&#8217; he cried, addressing
some of a knot of convicts who
stood looking at the sailors, &#8216;help those two
loafers, will ye? Show &#8217;em what to do, and
how it may be done quickly. We&#8217;ve been
having our training, boys,&#8217; he added, with a
great violent laugh, &#8216;whilst those chaps have
been a-bed sucking their pipes.&#8217;</p>

<p>Three of the convicts sprang to his orders,
as sailors would to the command of an officer.
I caught Mr. Bates staring at Tom with
amazement and admiration. Just then Barney
Abram, dressed in Captain Sutherland&#8217;s
clothes, the brass button on either side the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302"></a>[302]</span>
naval peak of his cap glittering in the sun,
came out of a group of eight or ten of the
felons, who had been earnestly and soberly
talking abreast of the foremost quarter-boat,
and walked up to us.</p>

<p>&#8216;Dow, Butler,&#8217; he said, &#8216;we wa&#8217;t your
advice. The idea was to se&#8217;d the fellows
below adrift. But can we spare the boats?&#8217;</p>

<p>The others of the select crew he had been
talking to followed him and came about us.
The crowd was quickly swelled; before Tom
could fairly answer, the whole of the convicts
on the poop were swarming aft to the
wheel, near which we stood, to hear what was
said.</p>

<p>Tom, standing erect, folded his arms upon
his convict shirt and, gazing fixedly at the
prize-fighter, said: &#8216;I&#8217;ll not counsel you. I
accept no responsibility where life is concerned.
That was understood.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;You cad give us ad idea?&#8217;</p>

<p>Tom shook his head. &#8216;You have put this
ship into my hands and I&#8217;ll carry her where
you will,&#8217; said he. &#8216;I&#8217;ve got no ideas outside
that.&#8217;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303"></a>[303]</span>I heard some murmurs as of grumbling,
and some of the ugly faces looked savage.</p>

<p>&#8216;You may growl as you please,&#8217; said Tom,
running his eyes angrily along the crowd of
felons. &#8216;I&#8217;ve agreed to undertake as much
as you have a right to expect. In agreeing
to take charge, I convert myself into head
criminal aboard you here; and of you all, I&#8217;m
the surest to be hanged if we&#8217;re taken. Act
as you please. Do what you like. My part&#8217;s
big enough, isn&#8217;t it?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Yar might just answer a question!&#8217;
exclaimed a convict.</p>

<p>&#8216;You want to turn the people below
adrift,&#8217; said Tom to Abram. &#8216;Do so.&#8217;</p>

<p>Mr. Bates looked at the sultry, breathless
expanse of ocean; I caught his eye and
witnessed horror and consternation in it.</p>

<p>&#8216;How bany boats are we to give &#8217;eb?&#8217;
said Abram.</p>

<p>&#8216;Reckon the number of people, then find
out the carrying capacity of the long-boat and
quarter-boats. See that they are plentifully
watered and provisioned. Give &#8217;em a sextant
and charts, sails, oars, and rudders; let them<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304"></a>[304]</span>
be wanting in nothing. It may tell for us,
Abram. That&#8217;s all I mean to say&mdash;the rest
you can do for yourselves.&#8217;</p>

<p>Whilst Tom spoke, the prize-fighter&#8217;s
dead-black, fiery eyes were fixed upon Mr.
Bates; his pock-marked face wore its habitual
sardonic, leering, self-complacent expression.</p>

<p>&#8216;Is it understood,&#8217; said he, &#8216;that Bates is
to help you to sail this ship?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;Certainly. I must have help. I&#8217;ve told
you I can&#8217;t stand a twenty-four-hours&#8217; watch.
I ask for no better sailor to help me than
Bates.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;He was one of the ship&#8217;s officers, and
we&#8217;ll hold you responsible for his behaviour
if you employ him,&#8217; said one of the convicts,
a tall, thin, gray-haired man, delicate, with
something of refinement in his face, speaking
with an educated accent.</p>

<p>&#8216;Parsons, I can&#8217;t navigate this ship alone.
I suppose you know that,&#8217; said Tom, with
heat.</p>

<p>&#8216;We shall want to feel when we&#8217;ve turned
in that we&#8217;re being honestly steered,&#8217; answered
the convict.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305"></a>[305]</span>(Tom afterward told me that this man had
been a surgeon in a fair way of practice in a
London suburb, and had been sentenced to
transportation for life for arson.)</p>

<p>&#8216;What do you know about the sea?&#8217; cried
my sweetheart, with the utmost scorn.
&#8216;Abram, I can endure sensible opposition,
but this sort of jaw is swinish. My neck&#8217;ll
fit a halter as well as his,&#8217; he added, pointing
to Parsons; &#8216;but my life is more precious,
certainly, for you&#8217;d not miss him if he dropped
overboard; but let me go, and if this gentleman,&#8217;
and here he clapped Bates upon the
shoulder, &#8216;refused to stand by you, and carry
you to an agreed part of the world, I&#8217;d give
you a week to be dismasted, to be pumping
for your lives, to be in the utmost extremity.
Have you sought your liberty to end as puffed
and green carcasses a hundred fathoms deep
over the side if the sharks let you plumb that
depth?&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;There&#8217;s too buch talk,&#8217; said Barney
Abram. &#8216;Is every bad to be baster? Butler&#8217;s
the agreed captid. He chooses Bates to
help hib. Bates he shall have, ad to prove<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306"></a>[306]</span>
that we trust hib he shall give directions for
getting the boat over and sedding the prisoders
adrift. Cub along, sir, and give us the
pleasure of hearing you sig out.&#8217;</p>

<p>He passed his giant arm through the poor
mate&#8217;s and walked off with him in the direction
of the main-deck. The convicts followed
to a man, talking eagerly and tumultuously
as they pressed forward in the wake of the
two. I said softly, that the fellow at the
wheel might not hear me: &#8216;They seem afraid
of you, Tom.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8216;I am one of them,&#8217; he answered, bitterly.
&#8216;They are not afraid of me. But the thoughtful
amongst them know they are helpless
without me, and the other wretches are influenced
by the few who can think.&#8217;</p>

1.B. &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; is a registered trademark. It may only be

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic works

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&trade; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&trade;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&trade; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&trade;
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&trade; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&trade;&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&trade; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&trade; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&trade; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&trade; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&trade; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block;margin:1em 0'>
This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg&trade;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
